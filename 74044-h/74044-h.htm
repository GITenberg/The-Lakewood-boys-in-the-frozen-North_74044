<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
SHIPWRECKED.
</h3>

<p>
G-R-R-R&mdash;R!  Thump!
</p>

<p>
"What was that?"
</p>

<p>
Jack Lakewood stuck his head out from the lower
bunk as he almost yelled the question.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter now?" came in sleepy tones
from the upper bunk.
</p>

<p>
"Sounded as though we'd struck something."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go back to sleep, you've been having a nightmare."
</p>

<p>
"Night-mare nothing.  Listen."
</p>

<p>
A faint sound of voices reached their ears and, a
moment later, the sound of hurrying footsteps past
the door of their state-room brought Jack out into
the middle of the room.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you we hit something," he cried.  "Don't
you notice that the engines have stopped?"
</p>

<p>
"You're right about that anyhow," Bob Lakewood
replied as he slid from the upper bunk to the floor.
"We'd better get dressed so as to be on the safe
side."
</p>

<p>
"I'll say we had," Jack agreed pulling off his
pajamas.  "I don't suppose it's anything&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"All hands on deck, quick!"
</p>

<p>
The order was shouted outside their door to be
repeated an instant later further down the corridor.
</p>

<p>
"That sounds ominous," Bob declared pulling on
his trowsers.
</p>

<p>
"I'll say it does.  We'd better make it snappy."
</p>

<p>
"Don't forget your money."
</p>

<p>
"And we'd better slip on a life preserver," Jack
added as he pulled two of them out from beneath
the bunk.
</p>

<p>
"Wonder what we hit?" Bob asked as he strapped
the life preserver over his coat.
</p>

<p>
"Iceberg likely, or maybe a derelict."
</p>

<p>
"More likely the latter," Bob said.
</p>

<p>
"You ready?"
</p>

<p>
"Come on."
</p>

<p>
Bob pulled the door open and they stepped out
into the corridor.  The sound of voices some shrill
and others low and gruff seemed to fill the ship.  As
they started toward the stairway, a little way back,
a half dressed woman, her arms filled with clothes,
rushed up to them.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what has happened?" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid we hit something," Bob told her.
</p>

<p>
"Is the ship going to sink?" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"I hope not," Bob tried to reassure her.  "But
you had better get back to your state-room and finish
dressing and put on a preserver."
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure there'll be time?"
</p>

<p>
"I think so.  Where is your room?"
</p>

<p>
"Just around the corner."
</p>

<p>
"Are you alone?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, all alone.  Oh, this is awful.  I know the
ship is going to sink and we'll all be drowned."
</p>

<p>
"Come quick," Bob ordered taking hold of her
arm and drawing her along.  "Is this your room?"
he asked as he turned a corner and saw a door half
open.
</p>

<p>
"This is it, yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then lose no time.  Put on the warmest thing
you have and, as soon as you're ready, I'll strap on
your life preserver."
</p>

<p>
The woman slipped into the room and closed the
door while he was speaking.
</p>

<p>
"All hands on deck, and make it quick."
</p>

<p>
Doors were opening all along the corridor now
and people, some fully dressed and others only half
clothed, were rushing toward the stairway.
</p>

<p>
"Better put on life preservers," Bob yelled.
</p>

<p>
Some turned back at the suggestion while others
in a state of frenzy rushed along the corridor intent
only on getting to the upper deck.
</p>

<p>
"Why doesn't she hurry?" Jack asked impatiently
as he glanced both ways.
</p>

<p>
"I'm ready."
</p>

<p>
The door was pushed open and the boys stepped
in.  The woman, or rather girl, for she could not
have been more than twenty, was now fully dressed
and, reaching beneath the bunk, Bob dragged out a
life preserver and, an instant later, had it strapped
securely about her.
</p>

<p>
"It's so brave and kind of you to wait for me," she
whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Got a bag?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"All my valuables are in this little bag," she
replied picking up a small leather bag from the bunk.
"I suppose I'll have to leave my trunk here," she
sighed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid so," Bob said.  "And you'd better
take the bag as we may be separated," he added.
</p>

<p>
"All hands out on deck.  No time to lose."
</p>

<p>
"I'm ready," she cried, and the next moment they
were hurrying along the corridor evidently the last
of those who had rooms in that part of the ship.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think we're too late?" she gasped as they
reached the foot of the stairway.
</p>

<p>
"No, they'll have boats enough to hold everybody.
Have to since the Titanic went down, you know,"
Bob told her as they started to mount the stairs.
</p>

<p>
On deck the scene was one of indescribable
confusion.  Officers were rushing about shouting out
orders and trying to calm the excited passengers,
while the creak of ropes as the life boats were lowered
added a sinister note to the occasion.  Cries of
men trying to locate their wives or children and of
women separated from their loved ones, added also
to the confusion.
</p>

<p>
"Women and children first.  Stand back there or
I'll fire."
</p>

<p>
The deck was lighted by many lights and the boys
could see the captain of the ship, close by the rail,
as he endeavored to hold back the swarm of fear
crazed men from the steerage as they fought for a
place in each boat before it was lowered to the water.
</p>

<p>
But he might as well have tried to hold back the
tide itself.  The crowd, many of them foreigners,
fought like wild beasts and there was immediate
danger that the brave captain would be overpowered.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, Jack boy, we've got to take a hand in
this," Bob said in a low voice as he grabbed the girl
by the arm and urged her forward.
</p>

<p>
Holding her close as possible he pushed into the
fighting mob closely followed by Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Way for the lady," he shouted pushing a big
Swede aside.
</p>

<p>
With a snort of anger the man aimed a blow for
Bob's head but he saw it coming in time to duck and
the next instant he had planted a beautiful right,
with all his strength behind it, on the point of the
Swede's chin.  The man went down as though a
sledge hammer had struck him and, for an instant,
the crowd gave way enabling them to reach the
captain's side.  A boat was just being lowered and, as
Bob spied an empty seat close up by the bow, he
shouted:
</p>

<p>
"There's room for one more there, Captain."
</p>

<p>
"All right, but hurry," the captain cried.
</p>

<p>
Both boys helped the girl over the side into the
boat and, a moment later she vanished as it quickly
slid down to the water.
</p>

<p>
There had been a moment's pause in the mad
struggle for a place in the boats but now, as another
was swung over the side, the rush began again.
</p>

<p>
"Back, you men.  Women and children first," the
captain again shouted waving his revolver.
</p>

<p>
"I've as mooch right ter save my life as a woman,"
shouted a big German as he reached for the side of
the swinging boat.
</p>

<p>
"Not on this boat, you haven't," Bob yelled as he
seized the man by the coat collar and yanked him
back.
</p>

<p>
The man fell sprawling on the deck and, before
he could scramble to his feet, Bob had leaped onto
the rail where he stood holding onto a rope.  Lifting
his free hand high in the air he shouted at the top of
his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Are you all cowards?  There are still women and
children to go in the boats.  Let's be men."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah for the kid," shouted a voice some feet
away.
</p>

<p>
The effect, whether of Bob's short speech or of
the man's cheer, was magical and Jack, who was
directly in front of his brother, was quick to take
advantage of the lull in the mad struggle.
</p>

<p>
"Make way, now, for those women behind there,"
he shouted as he urged aside those in front of him.
</p>

<p>
Like children the foreigners obeyed and in an
instant he had opened up a lane and was beckoning
to a dozen women and as many children who had
been standing back despairing of being able to get
to the boat.
</p>

<p>
"Quick, now," he ordered, motioning them to come.
</p>

<p>
They rushed after him and, a moment later another
boat load was lowered to the water.
</p>

<p>
Much the same scene had been taking place in
other parts of the ship where the boats were being
filled under the supervision of the officers, but
nowhere had the confusion been so great as here.  And
now, it being pretty certain that all the women and
children had been placed in the boats, the men were
allowed to take their places and boat after boat was
quickly filled and lowered.  In this work Bob and
Jack assisted the captain in keeping some semblance
of order and that officer was loud in his praise of
their action.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what I would have done had it not
been for you," he panted as, all the passengers in
sight having found a place in the life boats they had
a moment's breathing spell.
</p>

<p>
"You think she'll go down?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"No doubt of it.  See how she's settling in the
bow."
</p>

<p>
A single glance was enough to convince even a
land lubber that the big ship was doomed.  Already
the deck sloped sharply toward the bow and in
addition there was a decided list to port.
</p>

<p>
"You boys get into this boat," the captain ordered
as two sailors swung the last boat in sight over the
side.  "I must make sure that no one is left
behind."  And, before they could say a word he was off down
the stairway.
</p>

<p>
There seemed nothing to do but obey his order
and they lost no time in climbing into the boat.
</p>

<p>
"Is this the last one?" Jack asked one of the sailors
who was holding on to the rope.
</p>

<p>
"No, there's three or four more on the upper deck
but I reckon we won't need 'em.  Most of the crew
has gone already."
</p>

<p>
"Will he have time to make the round of the
ship?" Bob asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Reckon so.  The mates are helpin' him.  She
ought ter hold up another fifteen minutes or so."
</p>

<p>
"What did we hit?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nobody knows fer sure, but it must have been
a derelict an' a sunken one at that 'cause the lookout
swears as how he was on his job an' that there wasn't
a thing in sight an' Toby's a good man all right."
</p>

<p>
"Probably you're right," Bob agreed.
</p>

<p>
At that moment two men came running from the
stern of the ship and Bob noticed that they wore the
uniforms of first and second mates.
</p>

<p>
"Hasn't the captain come back yet?" the first mate
asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," one of the sailors replied.
</p>

<p>
"It's strange.  We left him below and he didn't
have as much of the ship to look through as we did,
and he ought to be here."
</p>

<p>
"He'll have to hustle or he'll be too late," the
second mate declared.  "She's going to take her last
dive before many minutes."
</p>

<p>
As he finished speaking all the lights suddenly
went out.  Fortunately it was moonlight and they
could see for some distance.
</p>

<p>
"Water's got up to the dynamos," the first mate
announced.
</p>

<p>
"And what's more the wind's getting up too," the
other mate said.
</p>

<p>
When the boys had first reached the deck there
was only a light breeze blowing, but it had been
steadily increasing and now had grown to a strong
wind.
</p>

<p>
"We can't wait much longer," the second mate
declared.  "What in the world do you suppose is
keeping him?"
</p>

<p>
"But you wouldn't go without him?" Bob suggested.
</p>

<p>
"I'd hate to, but there's no use in all of us going
down."
</p>

<p>
"Which we're going to do if we're not off in less
than ten minutes," the other added.  "I tell you she's
going down mighty soon."
</p>

<p>
"Then let's go."
</p>

<p>
"But we can't leave him," Bob insisted.
</p>

<p>
"You jest watch us, matey," one of the sailors
broke in as he sprang over the rail into the boat still
holding the lowering rope.
</p>

<p>
"Give me five minutes and I'll go see if I can find
him," Bob proposed.
</p>

<p>
"All right, but yer've got to hustle," the sailors
agreed grudgingly.
</p>

<p>
Bob waited no longer, but dashed for the stairway.
</p>

<p>
"You go back, Jack," he shouted as he turned at
the head of the stairs and saw his brother close at
his heels.
</p>

<p>
"Back nothing," the boy yelled.  "Now, don't stop
to argue because it won't do any good."
</p>

<p>
Bob knew his brother well enough to know that
it would be useless to say anything more so he leaped
down the stairs and Jack followed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Captain!" he shouted as soon as he had
reached the foot.
</p>

<p>
There was no answer.
</p>

<p>
"He must be up forward somewhere," Jack
shouted as he started toward the bow.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately the boys had had the foresight to slip
into their pockets their flashlights and, with their
aid, they quickly located a door on the far side of
the large hall, which opened into a corridor leading
to the bow.  On both sides of this corridor were
staterooms and into these they peeped, Bob taking those
on the right side while Jack followed suit on the
left.  But the captain was in none of them and they
reached the open deck in the bow without having
discovered him.  From time to time they had called
at the top of their voice without result.
</p>

<p>
"If he's in this part of the boat he must be dead
or unconscious," Bob declared as he threw the light
from his flash over the deck.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's no use standing here," Jack
returned.  "There's a passage on each side close to
the rail.  You take one and I'll take the other."
</p>

<p>
As Bob reached the right hand rail he noticed with
a shudder of alarm that the water was nearly on a
level with the deck.  "She can't stay afloat much
longer," he thought as he pushed open the door of
the first room.
</p>

<p>
He had covered about half the rooms in the row
when he heard a faint cry from the other side of the
ship.
</p>

<p>
"Bob&mdash;Bob.  This way, quick!"
</p>

<p>
Like a flash he sped down the corridor and, as he
reached the other side of the ship, he saw Jack
standing about half way down the passageway.
</p>

<p>
"Found him?" he yelled.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he in this room, but I'm afraid he's dead."
</p>

<p>
By this time Bob was at the door of the stateroom
and, a moment later, was bending over the
body of the captain who was stretched on the floor
face up.
</p>

<p>
"He isn't dead," he announced after he had laid
his head on his chest.
</p>

<p>
"Then we've got to get him up.  You take his
head and I'll take his feet.  Quick now."
</p>

<p>
Fortunately the captain was not a large man and
could not have weighed over one hundred and forty
pounds so they had little trouble in carrying him.
</p>

<p>
"Wonder if they've waited," Jack panted as they
came to the foot of the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"We've been gone mor'n five minutes," Bob told him.
</p>

<p>
A moment later they had reached the middle deck
and their first glance was toward the rail where they
had left the two mates and the two sailors.
</p>

<p>
"They've gone!" Bob gasped.
</p>

<p>
"What do you know about that?  The cowards!"
Jack added.

CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
THE STRUGGLE.
</h3>

<p>
Ten days previous to the events related in the
preceding chapter Bob and Jack Lakewood were
preparing to return East for the fall term at College.
They had spent the summer on the Lazy S ranch a
few miles from the little town of Cold Springs in the
State of Texas, except for a few weeks during which
they had been in Mexico, hunting for a lost mine.
It was late in October and ordinarily college would
have opened several weeks before but, owing to a
serious outbreak of influenza, the opening had been
delayed, giving them several weeks more of vacation.
</p>

<p>
The day before they were to start a telegram had
come from their father, bidding them to delay their
departure until a letter, which he had already sent,
should reach them.
</p>

<p>
"That's funny," Bob said as he handed the
telegram to Jack.
</p>

<p>
"What do you suppose is up?" Jack asked as soon
as he had read it.
</p>

<p>
"Curiosity killed a cat, you know."
</p>

<p>
The last remark came from a girl with bobbed
hair and a slightly turned up nose, who had read the
message over Jack's shoulder.  Her name was Sue
Stebbins and her father, Jeb Stebbins, was manager
of the large ranch which was owned by a Mr. Leeds
who lived in the East.  Sue, who was something of
a tomboy when it came to out-of-doors sports, ruled
all hands, including her father, with, as the latter
often declared, a rod of iron.  But her rule was a
generous one and she was a general favorite with all
the hands from the manager down to the Chinese
cook.
</p>

<p>
"If that was so you'd have been dead long ago,"
Jack retorted.  "You've only got one life, you know,
and a cat has nine."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not curious," Sue pouted.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, not a bit," Jack jeered.
</p>

<p>
"Well, anyhow, it gives you a few days more before
you have to go back to that horrid old college,"
she smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Who said it was horrid?" Jack demanded.
</p>

<p>
"I did.  Anything that takes you two away from
the ranch is horrid, so there."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon that settles it," Bob broke in laughingly.
"But, honestly, Sue, we hate to go worse than you
can possibly hate to have us."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we won't argue the point.  Come on, there's
just time for a gallop before supper."
</p>

<p>
It was three days before the letter came and Bob
read it with Jack and Sue looking over his shoulder.
It was as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
My dear boys:
</p>

<p>
My wire undoubtedly was a great surprise to you
and, of course, you have been wondering what it was
all about.
</p>

<p>
You will, no doubt, recall hearing me speak many
times of my brother, Silas, who lives in the State of
Washington.  You have never seen him as he is a
bit queer and has not been East for nearly thirty
years, although he has always been a great rover.
About six months ago he wrote me that he was going
to take a trip to Alaska and try his hand at mining.
Three months later I received a second letter from
Nome stating that he was about to start for the upper
waters of the Yukon with another man by the name
of Long and that they would be gone a month.  He
promised that he would write as soon as they
returned, but I have no word from him and, frankly,
I am worried.  He should have been back two months
ago and I should have heard from him a few days
later.
</p>

<p>
I have wired several times to Nome to find out if
he had returned, but each time have received a reply
stating nothing had been heard from them.
</p>

<p>
How would you like to take a trip up there and
see if you can find out what has become of him?  I
know you ought to be in college, but you are well
up in your studies and the trip will be a new one for
you.  I would go myself, but business will not let
me get away just now.  If your friend, Slats Magee,
can go with you so much the better.  I am so sure
that you will want to go that I am inclosing check
for expenses.  Wire what you will do.  Mother
sends lots of love as do I.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Your loving father.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Do we go?" Bob asked as he finished reading.
</p>

<p>
"Does a duck swim?" Jack laughed.
</p>

<p>
"But Slats is laid up with a broken leg," Bob said
mournfully.
</p>

<p>
"And, of course, that's too bad, but I reckon it
needn't stop us from going.  Father didn't say for
us not to go without him, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I know, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But nothing.  Father wants us to go whether
Slats can go or not and that settles it."
</p>

<p>
"How about taking me along to take care of you?"
Sue asked.
</p>

<p>
"Huh," Jack snorted.  "Anyone'd think we were a
couple of babies."
</p>

<p>
"And I reckon we'd have to have a chaperon along
if we took you," Bob laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course, I didn't mean it, but just the
same, I wish I was a boy and then I could go," Sue
pouted.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Stebbins, or Jeb as everyone called him, shook
his head when they showed him the letter.
</p>

<p>
"Your father has a lot of confidence in you for a
fact and I'm not saying that it's misplaced, but I
can't help thinking that it's risky for you two boys
to go away off up there.  If Slats could go along I'd
feel better about it but, of course, that's out of the
question.  Yes, I know your father wants you to
go," he added as Bob was about to speak, "and of
course, the thing for you to do is to go only&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Within an hour a wire was on its way to Mr. Lakewood,
saying that they were starting as soon
as they could get ready.  Then followed a busy time
looking up routes and making reservations, to say
nothing of outfitting themselves with clothing
suitable for wear in the far North.
</p>

<p>
Slats Magee, just beginning to hobble around, on
crutches, was loud in his bewailment of the fate
which kept him at home.
</p>

<p>
"If it was only an arm, now," he groaned.  "I'd
put it in a sling an' go anyhow."
</p>

<p>
They found that they could get a boat from Seattle
on a Monday and as that was only three days off,
they were kept busy the most of the time.  Finally
the moment came to say good-bye and, as the train
pulled out from Cold Springs, Sue waved her hand
from the platform and shouted:
</p>

<p>
"Look out you don't fall in love with an Esquimo
girl."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Hoping that the lifeboat might not have left the
side of the ship the boys laid the form of the captain
on the deck and rushed to the rail.
</p>

<p>
"Too late," Jack cried as he pointed to a spot of
light dancing up and down some distance from the
ship.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, they've gone all right," Bob agreed.
</p>

<p>
"What'll we do?"
</p>

<p>
"There must be another boat.  Didn't one of the
mates say there were others on the upper deck?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he said so, but do you suppose we can get it
over in time?"
</p>

<p>
"We can try."
</p>

<p>
Rushing back to the head of the stairway they
again picked the captain up and a moment later were
on the upper deck.  There they were encouraged to
find three lifeboats hanging from their davits and,
placing their burden gently down, they set about
getting it ready to lower.
</p>

<p>
"Hurry," Jack gasped as the boat gave a sickening
lurch.  "She's going in a minute or two."
</p>

<p>
Jack had quickly succeeded in getting his rope
clear, but Bob was not so fortunate.  His had gotten
caught and it took him some time to get it free.
</p>

<p>
"I'm doing the best I can," he panted pulling
frantically at the stiff rope.  "There, she's free.  Now
you hold them while I drag him over."
</p>

<p>
He handed his rope to Jack and rushed back a few
feet for the captain.  It was hard work getting him
into the boat, but it was finally accomplished and,
springing in after him, they quickly began to lower
away.  As the boat touched the water a heavy wave
dashed it against the side of the ship and all but
upset it, but Bob grabbed an oar and succeeded in
fending it off before the next wave hit them and, a
moment later, he was pulling on both oars with all
his strength.
</p>

<p>
They were not twenty feet away from the ship
when a loud explosion told them that the water had
reached the boilers.
</p>

<p>
"Guess that'll finish her," Bob gasped.
</p>

<p>
Hardly had he spoken when the stern of the ship
rose in the air and a moment later the ill-fated ship
slid beneath the waves.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Majestic," Jack groaned.
</p>

<p>
Now that the danger from the suction, caused by
the big ship, was over, Bob rested on his oars and
looked about him.  The sea was rough and the
lifeboat danced up and down, but he knew there was no
danger unless the wind increased in strength.  Far
away he could see several points of light which he
knew marked the location of the other lifeboats, but
the boats themselves he could not see as heavy
clouds had obscured the moon.
</p>

<p>
"Guess we'd better pull toward them," he said as
he again bent to the oars.
</p>

<p>
"Let me take them," Jack suggested.
</p>

<p>
"You see if you can bring the captain around first.
I'm not tired yet."
</p>

<p>
The form of the captain lay on the bottom of the
boat at Jack's feet and the boy slid from his seat and
took his head in his lap.
</p>

<p>
"He's still breathing," he announced.
</p>

<p>
"Good.  Get some water on his head."
</p>

<p>
Under his ministrations the man soon sighed and,
a moment later opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Where am I?" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"You're safe," Jack replied.  "How do you feel?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll be all right in a minute.  The ship?  Did it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she went down," Jack told him.
</p>

<p>
The captain closed his eyes and for a moment did
not move.  Then he again opened them and, in a
much stronger voice, asked:
</p>

<p>
"How did I get in this boat?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, we put you in."
</p>

<p>
"But the others?"
</p>

<p>
"They're in another boat."
</p>

<p>
"They didn't wait?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Then how&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Better wait till you're a bit stronger, sir," Jack
suggested as the captain hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"I'm all right now," he insisted as he raised his
head from the boy's lap.
</p>

<p>
Seeing that he was determined to sit up Jack
helped him to the seat on which he had been sitting.
</p>

<p>
"Now suppose you tell me about it," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there isn't much to tell," Jack began.
"When you didn't come back we went to find you
and&mdash;and found you."
</p>

<p>
"But where were the two mates?  Did they get
back before you left?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, why didn't they go?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I guess I can see about the way it was and
I guess I owe my life to you two boys.  But, tell me,
didn't they agree to wait till you came back?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, they said they'd wait five minutes, but I
guess we were considerable longer than that," Jack
told him.
</p>

<p>
"And they went off without you, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid they did, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I know it, but perhaps it's best not to judge them
too harshly.  I suppose a man has a right to save his
own life."
</p>

<p>
"But what happened to you, sir?" Bob asked as
he rested on his oars for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"I must have fainted," the captain told them.
"You see I was subject to fainting spells some years
ago and had to give up the sea for several years
but, after I had gone five years without a single one,
I thought I was over them and persuaded the owners
to let me have a command again.  This was my first
voyage," he groaned.  "But I suppose the excitement
and severe strain was responsible for the
relapse.  I shall never try it again."
</p>

<p>
"Do we seem to be getting any nearer the other
boats?" Bob asked a little later.
</p>

<p>
"It's hard to say," the captain replied.  "But I
don't think we're gaining much if any."
</p>

<p>
"Let me spell you now," Jack said as he rose from
his seat.
</p>

<p>
While they had been talking the wind had been
steadily rising and now it was blowing almost a gale
making it difficult to keep the boat's head into the
wind.
</p>

<p>
"Just a minute," Bob cried pulling strongly on his
right oar.  "It won't do to let her get broadside," he
added as he moved over on his seat to give Jack
room.
</p>

<p>
It was a fortunate thing that they were used to
boats else it is doubtful if they would have been able
to change places without allowing the craft to wallow
in the trough, but they finally accomplished it and
Bob was glad to rest his aching arms.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any idea how far we are from shore,
sir?" he asked as soon as he had settled himself in
the seat beside the captain.
</p>

<p>
"A matter of twenty-five or thirty miles.  As you
know we were about twelve hours out, but we've
been running not far from land."
</p>

<p>
In spite of his warm clothing Bob's teeth soon began
to chatter as the night was cold and he had been
sweating from the violent exercise of rowing.
Fortunately the captain had on his heavy coat and,
although he acknowledged that he was none too warm,
he was not shivering.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think of the weather, sir?" Bob
asked a few minutes later.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like it.  I'm afraid we'll have snow
before morning."
</p>

<p>
As if to confirm his words Bob felt a snow flake
strike his face.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you're right, sir," he said.
</p>

<p>
The first flake was quickly followed by others and
in less than ten minutes they were flying thick and
fast driven by the strong wind, and so great was
their velocity that they stung like needles as they
struck the skin.
</p>

<p>
"Getting tired, Jack?" Bob shouted.
</p>

<p>
"No, not yet," Jack called stoutly back.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm coming anyhow so move over.  There's
no use in taking too long shifts and, besides, I want
to get warmed up a bit," he added as he reached the
seat by his brother's side.  "We've simply got to
take it as easy as we can for goodness knows how
long we'll have to keep this up."
</p>

<p>
The lights from the other boats had disappeared
soon after it had begun to snow and now there was
nothing to be seen about them save the swirling snow
and the white foam of the water as the wind blew off
the tops of the waves.
</p>

<p>
"Wonder if there's anything to eat or drink in this
boat," Jack said as soon as he had reached his former
seat beside the captain.
</p>

<p>
"There should be both food and water," the latter
replied.  "All the lifeboats are kept stocked in case
of an emergency such as this."
</p>

<p>
"Where would it be?"
</p>

<p>
"Right back of you in the locker."
</p>

<p>
Jack turned half around and, reaching beneath the
seat in the stern lifted the cover of a small box fitted
in the narrow space.  But it was empty and, with
a sinking heart, he turned back.
</p>

<p>
"Guess they forgot to stock this boat," he announced.
</p>

<p>
"You mean there's nothing there?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a thing."
</p>

<p>
"It's criminal negligence," the captain declared.
"It's the purser's business to see that the lifeboats
are kept stocked, but the fellow we have is always
neglecting his work, but, as he's some relative of
the owners it's been overlooked and now we've got
to suffer for it."
</p>

<p>
The storm seemed to increase and Bob was having
all he could do to keep the boat head on.  He had lost
all sense of direction and had no idea whether he was
rowing toward the shore or out to sea.  They were
running with the wind and he judged that they must
be making several miles an hour.
</p>

<p>
"It's my turn now," the captain shouted a few
minutes after Jack had discovered the lack of food
and water.
</p>

<p>
Both boys protested against the move, but the
man declared that he was all right and well able to
do his share of the work.
</p>

<p>
"Besides I need to get warmed up a bit," he added
as he shifted his position to the rower's seat.
</p>

<p>
"Looks like we might not get out of this scrape,"
Jack said in a low tone as soon as Bob was seated
beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Never say die," Bob replied hopefully.  "I've
seen sicker cats than this get well, and don't forget,
Jack boy, that God can take care of us just as well
out here as He can on the land."
</p>

<p>
"I know it and, believe me, I've been asking Him
to do that very thing."
</p>

<p>
"So have I, and I believe He will."
</p>

<p>
The dismal night wore on.  At times the snow
slackened until it had almost ceased only to swirl
down harder than ever a few minutes later.  The
wind kept about the same.  Every half hour they
changed shifts, as Jack called it, an arrangement
which gave each an hour's rest after a half hour of
strenuous labor.  And each welcomed the chance to
row in spite of the hard work as he suffered with the
cold while resting.
</p>

<p>
"It'll be daylight in another hour," Bob announced
as he moved to Jack's side to take his shift.
</p>

<p>
"But I don't believe we'll be able to see much
better than we can now unless this snow lets up," Jack
declared as he gave up the oars.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it can't keep on snowing forever," Bob
added hopefully.
</p>

<p>
Just at that instant, as they were changing places,
an extra strong gust struck the boat and Bob, feeling
the bow swing off, put all his strength into his left
oar in a desperate effort to straighten his course.
Snap!  The oar broke like a pipe stem and the boat
was wallowing in the trough in an instant.  Almost
instantly a huge wave broke over it filling it half
full of water and nearly throwing it over.
</p>

<p>
"She'll go over in a minute," Bob shouted.
</p>

<p>
An instant later and his words proved true for the
very next wave caught the boat just right and over
she went.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
THE CABIN BY THE SHORE.
</h3>

<p>
The water was icy cold and as Bob went beneath
the surface it seemed to him that his blood froze in
his veins.  Thanks to the cork jacket which he had
kept on his head bobbed out of the water almost
immediately and, as he rose on the top of a wave, he
looked about for Jack, and saw him only a few feet
away.
</p>

<p>
"Where's the captain?" he shouted.
</p>

<p>
"Don't know," Jack shouted back shaking the
water from his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Both boys were expert swimmers and, with the
help of the life preservers, they had no difficulty in
keeping afloat although the big waves dashed over
their heads filling their eyes with salt water.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid he's a goner," Bob gasped as he fought
his way to his brother's side.  "He didn't have on a
preserver, you know."
</p>

<p>
"And I reckon we're goners too in spite of them,"
Jack chattered back.
</p>

<p>
Bob felt in his heart that Jack was right unless a
miracle happened as he well knew that no one could
live long in that cold water which seemed to penetrate
to the very marrow of the bones.
</p>

<p>
"Swim hard so as to keep up the circulation," he
began and then paused as his eyes caught sight of
something floating in the water only a few feet to his
right.  A few powerful strokes brought him to the
spot, but the object had disappeared.  With a prayer
on his lips he dove and swam downward with all his
strength.  Down, down, he struggled until he
knew that he had reached his limit.  Then, just
as he was about to turn, his outstretched hand
came in contact with something and he knew he
had found what he was after.  The memory of
that awful struggle to the surface haunted his
dreams for months afterward.  But, although it
seemed as though his lungs would burst with
pressure and he more than once nearly lost his hold,
he finally succeeded and, to his great relief, he came
up close beside Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Hold him a minute," he gasped.
</p>

<p>
As Jack relieved him he drank in great gulps of
air and immediately felt the strength pouring bade
info his body.
</p>

<p>
"Is he dead?" Jack shouted.
</p>

<p>
"Don't know, but we must keep him up as long as
we can."
</p>

<p>
"You bet."
</p>

<p>
Holding the form of the captain between them
they fought the waves striving to protect him from
their fury as much as possible.  The wind had swept
the overturned boat far beyond their reach and they
knew it would be useless to try to reach it.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I'm about all in," Jack gasped after they had
fought but a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
Bob knew that he himself was in about the same
condition, but he would not give up as long as an
ounce of strength remained.
</p>

<p>
"Let me have him while you rest a bit," he said
trying to keep his teeth from chattering and the
weakness from his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Not&mdash;much," he heard Jack murmur.
</p>

<p>
Bob did not have enough strength to insist and
so they kept on until it seemed he could not possibly
take another stroke.  Was this to be the end?
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I've got to&mdash;give&mdash;" he heard Jack cry but,
at the same moment his heart gave a great leap for
his feet touched something and, the next instant he
was standing only waist deep in the water and helping
Jack to recover his footing while holding the
captain's head above water with one hand.
</p>

<p>
"Just in time," he encouraged his brother.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I'll say&mdash;it was," Jack's teeth chattered so
that he could hardly speak.
</p>

<p>
Between them they managed to drag the unconscious
form of the captain through the shallow water
to the shore, which was covered to a depth of several
inches, with snow.
</p>

<p>
"What are we going to do?" Jack panted as he
looked about him.  "We'll all be frozen stiff in a few
minutes if we stand here.  Suppose we can get a fire
going?"
</p>

<p>
"I've got a waterproof box of matches somewhere
but I'm afraid we'll not be able to find anything
that'll burn."
</p>

<p>
"Well we'd better&mdash;" Jack began and then uttered
a cry of joy.  "There comes somebody," he shouted.
</p>

<p>
Through the gloom they could see a point of light
swinging in such a way that they knew someone was
approaching with a lantern.
</p>

<p>
"This way, quick," Bob shouted, and, a moment
later a tall, thickset man stood beside them.
</p>

<p>
"Whar from you come, oui?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"We were wrecked and&mdash;and, is there a house
near?" Bob replied.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, ver' close by," the man told them and then,
putting his hands to his mouth shouted: "Hey
Jacques, Pierre, come queek, queek."
</p>

<p>
It seemed that he had hardly called before an
answering shout came through the night and two
forms, dimly seen at first, soon joined them.
</p>

<p>
"You tak' heem to the house queek," the man
ordered, and as the others picked up the captain as
though he was a child, he turned to the boys.
</p>

<p>
"You think you walk heem?  Eet's just behind that
bush clump."
</p>

<p>
"Sure, we're all right," Bob assured him as they
started off through the snow.
</p>

<p>
As they rounded the clump of bushes a good sized
log cabin loomed before them and, in another minute,
they were inside in front of a roaring fireplace.
</p>

<p>
"You geet dem wet things off queek now and tak'
one bon rub with deese towel," their benefactor
ordered as he pulled a couple of coarse, but clean
towels from a chest.  "Dem boys dey look after
heem," he added nodding toward the other side of
the fire where Jacques and Pierre were already at
work stripping the wet clothing from the captain.
</p>

<p>
"Is&mdash;is he alive?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, heem still breath some, but heem one mighty
close call.  Mebby heem geet well, mebby not.  Eet
for the bon Dieu to say.  We do the best we can."
</p>

<p>
"God must have sent you out to us," Jack declared
rubbing his body till it glowed.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, Le Dieu, heem tell me go out.  Me go."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later wrapped in heavy blankets
they were toasting their feet in front of the fireplace
and drinking hot coffee while the captain, also
wrapped in blankets, had been placed in one of the
bunks which lined one side of the cabin, after
everything possible had been done.  He was still
unconscious and they knew that his life hung in the
balance.
</p>

<p>
"I never thought I'd be so warm again," Jack
sighed contentedly as he sipped his second dipper of
hot coffee.
</p>

<p>
"Nor did I," Bob agreed.  "It was little short of
a miracle.  But what I can't understand is why there
wasn't more surf where we came ashore."
</p>

<p>
"That's so.  I never thought of it, but it does
seem strange.  Maybe we drifted into a cove or
something."
</p>

<p>
"Reckon we must have."
</p>

<p>
"We'll ask one of the men when they come in,"
Jack said as he listened to the sounds which came
from a back room, which he supposed was the
kitchen and which indicated that they were getting
a meal.
</p>

<p>
"Wonder what became of the other boats."
</p>

<p>
"They didn't come in where we did, that's sure."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe they were picked up."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so."
</p>

<p>
The faint light of the coming dawn was just
beginning to steal in through the window when, a
little later, they heard a low moan from the bunk
where the captain had been laid.  Bob hurried across
the room, closely followed by Jack, and bent over
the bed.  The captain's eyes were open, but in them
was no sign of recognition.
</p>

<p>
"Hard to the starboard," he muttered.  And then,
"Starboard I said, not port."
</p>

<p>
Bob laid his hand on the man's forehead and, as he
expected, found it very hot.
</p>

<p>
"He's burning up with fever," he told Jack.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Pneumonia, most likely."
</p>

<p>
Just then the door opened and Pierre came in with
the announcement that breakfast was ready.
</p>

<p>
"The captain has recovered consciousness, but he's
out of his head," Bob told him.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, we thot he would be.  Jacques, heem gone
for doctor."
</p>

<p>
"How long will it take?"
</p>

<p>
"Eet tak' long time&mdash;too bad&mdash;eet thirty mile an
heem have to walk, but heem go ver' fast an' come
back wid horse, mebby gas wagon."
</p>

<p>
"But he may die before he gets the doctor here."
</p>

<p>
"I think not.  We geeve heem medicine."
</p>

<p>
"Pray God he may live," Bob sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, we pray.  Now you geet eats.  I watch heem."
</p>

<p>
Had food ever tasted so good as those baked beans
and hot biscuit to say nothing of the huge wedge of
apple pie which followed?  Both boys agreed that if
it had they had forgotten when or where.
</p>

<p>
"If I eat another mouthful I'll burst," Bob
declared as he pushed back his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I can still chew, but that's the limit.  There
won't another bit go down," Jack added.
</p>

<p>
Breakfast over they found that their clothes had
dried and they were soon, as Jack put it, clothed in
their right minds once more.  The three Frenchmen,
they soon learned, were trappers and had lived here
for years as they were brothers and none had married.
</p>

<p>
The captain was raving as they came again info
the big living room and, at times, Pierre was having
his hands full to hold him in the bunk.
</p>

<p>
"Heem ver' bad, but heem got lots strength an'
that bon sign," he said as they approached.
</p>

<p>
"You think he'll pull through?" Bob asked
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"No can tell."  Pierre shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Can we do anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Non.  I geeve him medicine, all we can do."
</p>

<p>
As they walked slowly around the clump of
bushes and looked out over the tumbling water they
saw that their conjecture regarding the surf, or
rather the lack of it, had been correct.  A small cove,
the points of which were only a few yards apart,
broke the violence of the waves, making the water
inside comparatively still.
</p>

<p>
"It's lucky we hit the opening," Bob said as he
watched the rollers come in and break outside the
cove.
</p>

<p>
"I'll say it was.  I doubt if we could have gotten
ashore outside without having the life knocked out
of us," Jack agreed.
</p>

<p>
"It's awful when you think what may have happened
to the rest of them," Bob said as they turned
back.
</p>

<p>
"But they may have been picked up or got ashore
all right."
</p>

<p>
"We'll hope so at any rate."
</p>

<p>
It was nearly two o'clock when the doctor came
in a small touring car with Jacques.  After a hasty
examination he confirmed their fears that it was
pneumonia.
</p>

<p>
"Both lungs are congested," he told them.  "But
his heart action is strong and he's evidently lived a
clean life, two very important factors in a case of
this kind."
</p>

<p>
"Then you think he has a chance?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Sure he has," the doctor assured him.  "But, of
course, you never can tell how pneumonia is going
to turn out.  Much depends on the nursing."
</p>

<p>
"Can we get a trained nurse?"
</p>

<p>
"You've got one."  The doctor nodded toward
Pierre who had stepped over to the fireplace.  "What
that fellow doesn't know about nursing hasn't yet
been learned.  I'd rather have him than anyone I
know."
</p>

<p>
"He was the captain of the steamer."
</p>

<p>
"Is that so?  How did it happen that you three
were together?"
</p>

<p>
Bob told him the story of their escape.  "Did you
hear anything of any of the other boats?" he asked
when he had finished.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, three of them came ashore about ten miles
down the coast and the others were picked up early
this morning a few miles out."
</p>

<p>
"Then there were no deaths?"
</p>

<p>
"Not unless some of them die from the effects."
</p>

<p>
"It's good to know that," Bob assured him.
</p>

<p>
The doctor left an hour later promising to come
again the next day and somehow the boys felt
encouraged although they realized that the captain was
a very sick man.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to stay here till it goes one way or
the other," Bob whispered to Jack as the doctor
drove off.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, unless we'll be in the way."
</p>

<p>
But Baptist, the older of the three brothers and the
one who had found them, assured them that so far
from being in the way, they could do much to help
as they had their traps to see to.  So they remained
and did all they could to help about the place.  When
the doctor came the next day he found his patient
about the same and told them that in all probability
there would not be much change for another week
at least.  When he left the boys asked him to take a
message to wire to their father and also to the ranch
that they were safe.
</p>

<p>
Day followed day with little or no change in the
sick man.  Pierre was untiring in his nursing and
the boys soon found that the doctor's praise had not
been misplaced.  No woman could have been more
tender than was this rough appearing Frenchman.
Night and day he watched by the bed of the stricken
man leaving his post only long enough to snatch a
few hours' sleep each day.  At times the captain was
in his right mind for a few minutes and then he
recognized them with a faint smile of gratitude.
But for the most part he lay in a stupor.  Only
occasionally did he rave and then his mutterings were
all of the sea.
</p>

<p>
Once his heart nearly stopped beating and Pierre
thought, for a moment that he was gone, but an
injection of a powerful stimulant brought him
around.  Then, a few days later, came the crisis and
the two boys waited with bated breath while Pierre
bent over the bunk watching for the slightest sign of
change.
</p>

<p>
"Queek.  The blankets," he shouted suddenly, and
they grabbed from before the fireplace the thick
woolen blankets which had been hanging there for
several hours.
</p>

<p>
"Shut the windows," Pierre ordered as he
snatched them from their hands.
</p>

<p>
Quickly he wrapped the man in the warm folds
and then sat with his fingers on his pulse.
</p>

<p>
"Heem will live."  Pierre sprang to his feet as he
made the announcement and the boys never forgot
the look on his face as he closed his eyes.  They
knew he was praying and they bowed their heads.
</p>

<p>
"See heem sweat."
</p>

<p>
Bending over the captain, who lay with closed
eyes, they could see the great drops of sweat on his
forehead and knew that Pierre had spoken the truth.
The fever was broken and, barring the unexpected,
the captain was on the road to recovery.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God," Bob breathed as they moved away.
</p>

<p>
"Amen," Jack added.
</p>

<p>
Great was the joy of Baptist and Jacques, when
they returned from a trip to their traps shortly
before dark, to learn the good news.
</p>

<p>
"And it's all due to your nursing, Pierre," Bob
declared.
</p>

<p>
"Non&mdash;non.  Le Bon Dieu, heem watch over
heem," the Frenchman insisted.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he'll pull through all right now," the doctor
said when he came the following day.  "Didn't I tell
you he was a good nurse?"
</p>

<p>
"He's the best ever," Bob assured him.
</p>

<p>
Another week and the captain was able to sit up
though still very weak.
</p>

<p>
"I owe my life twice to you boys," he said slowly
as Bob pushed his chair nearer to the fire.
</p>

<p>
"But most of all to Pierre," Bob reminded him.
</p>

<p>
"I know, and he shall have his reward if he will
accept it.  I am not a poor man by any means, but
what do you think?  Can I offer him money?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think he would accept it?"
</p>

<p>
"Nor do I.  And yet I must do something.  What
would you suggest?"
</p>

<p>
"Wait till you get home and then send them all a
good present."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do it.  You don't find men like them very
often."
</p>

<p>
It had been arranged that the boys were to leave
the next day.  Now that the captain was well out
of danger they felt that they must not delay longer
and the doctor was to take them back to the little
town thirty miles down the coast, where they could
get a train for Seattle.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
THE BOYS START AGAIN FOR ALASKA.
</h3>

<p>
"Well, we're off again."
</p>

<p>
It was two days after they had left the log cabin
by the sea and the steamer, on which they had, for
the second time, engaged passage, was drawing
slowly away from the wharf.
</p>

<p>
"And here's hoping we have better luck than last
time," Bob returned and he leaned over the rail.  "But
I might as well confess that I feel a bit squeemish."
</p>

<p>
"But lightning never strikes twice in the same
place you know," Jack laughed.
</p>

<p>
"And, by the same token, I don't suppose we're
likely to hit that same derelict but there are others,
you know," Bob smiled back.
</p>

<p>
"I know, but let's not borrow trouble."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, but are you Bob and Jack Lakewood?"
</p>

<p>
The boys turned quickly at the question and
were much surprised to see the captain of the ship
standing before them.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
Both boys answered at the same time.
</p>

<p>
"I thought so," the captain smiled, holding out
both hands which the boys, although greatly puzzled,
were quick to grasp.  "I am Richard Blake and, as
you have probably noted by my uniform, have the
honor to command this ship."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we noticed it," Jack said as the captain
paused.
</p>

<p>
"But you probably do not know that the man you
saved is my brother."
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, we did not.  He told us that his name
was Blake and that he had a brother who was also a
captain, but you do not look like him."  Bob smiled.
</p>

<p>
"That's true," the captain smiled back.  "Frank
is light and small while I am dark and rather above
the average in size, but he's my brother just the
same and more than that he's the best brother a man
ever had."
</p>

<p>
"I can easily believe that, sir," Bob began and
then stopped short.  "No, I don't either," he
corrected.  "Make it as good a brother as a man ever
had and I won't say a word, but he can't be any
better than the one I've got."
</p>

<p>
The captain again reached out his hand and, as
soon as Bob had grasped if, said:
</p>

<p>
"That's one of the finest things I ever heard, and
I'll accept the suggestion.  Son," he added turning to
Jack whose face was flushed, "you also have a good
brother so we might as well make it a trio."
</p>

<p>
"All I've got to say is that if you've got as good
a brother as I have you've got as good as they make,"
Jack grinned.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to try to thank you," the captain
continued after a moment's pause and both boys
noticed that his eyes were dim with tears.  "There
are some things which are beyond thanks and&mdash;and
I know you know how I feel."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed we do, sir," Jack assured him.
</p>

<p>
"But, during this trip you are my guests.  I have
already arranged for you to sit at my table."
</p>

<p>
"That's very good of you, sir, and we certainly
do appreciate it," Bob assured him.
</p>

<p>
"But please don't tell anyone about it," Jack
begged.
</p>

<p>
"I won't," the captain smiled.
</p>

<p>
But in some way or other the truth leaked out and
before the trip was a day old they, much to their
disgust, found themselves regarded as heroes by crew
and passengers alike.  But, in spite of it, the trip
proved most enjoyable.  The weather was perfect
and the captain seemed to take great delight in
showing them the different parts of the ship and in
answering their many questions.  They, in turn, took
him into their confidence as to the object of their
journey and he expressed great surprise that their
lather had sent them on such a mission.
</p>

<p>
"Alaska is a mighty big place," he told them, "and
in the winter it's a very rough place let me tell you."
</p>

<p>
"You think it's dangerous: the trip up the Yukon,
I mean?" Bob asked him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, for you two boys to take such a trip at this
time of the year would be decidedly dangerous, not
to say foolhardy, but if you get a good native to go
with you the risk will, of course, be much less."
</p>

<p>
"And do you think we can get one?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess there's little doubt about that provided
you can afford it.  They charge a pretty stiff price
these days."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure father would want us to have a guide
and will be willing to pay whatever is right."
</p>

<p>
"Then by all means do it."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know of a man we can get?"
</p>

<p>
"Not personally, but I know a fellow up there who
will know where to get the right man and I'll attend
to it."
</p>

<p>
"That's very good of you, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Good nothing," the captain interrupted.  "You
forget what I owe you two boys."
</p>

<p>
It was late in the afternoon when, a few days later,
the ship steamed up to her wharf at Nome.
</p>

<p>
"My, it's quite some city," Jack declared as he
stood with Bob and the captain in the pilot house.
</p>

<p>
"Largest in Alaska," the captain assured them.
</p>

<p>
"What's the population?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"It was about 2,600 the last census and I guess it
hasn't changed much since."
</p>

<p>
The captain had invited them to remain on board
as his guests while the ship remained in port instead
of going to a hotel and they had been glad to accept
the invitation.
</p>

<p>
"The ship will be here for three days and I won't
have much to do so we can put in the time together
getting your outfit in shape," he told them.
</p>

<p>
"That'll be fine if you can spare the time," Bob
assured him.
</p>

<p>
"It'll keep me out of mischief," the man laughed.
</p>

<p>
"But don't you think it would be a good idea to
see if we can find someone who knew my uncle?  You
see he was here for several weeks and he must have
gotten acquainted with somebody who would know
something about where he started for," Jack
suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, and I think I can name the very man
to go to.  If he got well acquainted with anyone here
the chances are a hundred to one that it was Pete
Slinger.  Pete's a character, but a good reliable man
all the same.  I don't believe there's a man, woman
or child in Nome that doesn't know Pete well enough
to call him by his first name and as for Pete&mdash;well,
he can tell you the life history of about everyone
who has spent upwards of two days in Nome during
the past ten years."
</p>

<p>
"Is he Irish?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Irish and French."
</p>

<p>
"What does he do?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"Keeps a store and sells everything from tooth
picks to second hand pulpits."
</p>

<p>
"He ought to do some business," Bob remarked.
</p>

<p>
"He does.  He looks like a tramp, but I guess
there's little doubt, but that he's a got a good sized
roll laid up against a rainy day.  We'll go and see him
right after supper tonight."
</p>

<p>
As the three friends walked up the main street of
the town that night the boys were much surprised
to find that it differed but little from towns with
which they were familiar in the northern part of
Maine.  Except for an occasional Esquimo the people
also seemed much the same being largely French
Canadians with a liberal sprinkling of Americans.
</p>

<p>
"Gee, I expected to see polar bears running about
the streets," Jack laughed.
</p>

<p>
"And reindeer pulling the pungs I suppose," the
captain added.
</p>

<p>
"Sure thing," Jack assured him whereat they all
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, here we are," the captain said as they
stopped in front of one of the largest buildings on
the street.  "This is Pete's place."
</p>

<p>
There were several men and two or three women
in the store as they entered, but no sooner did the
proprietor catch sight of the captain than he dropped
a sugar scoop back in the barrel and, pushing his
customers right and left, came rushing up.
</p>

<p>
"Faith an' yer a sight fer sore eyes so yer be,"
he cried as he grasped the captain's hands in both of
his.
</p>

<p>
"And, believe me, I'm glad to see you again," the
captain laughed.  "But I want you to meet my two
friends, Bob and Jack Lakewood."
</p>

<p>
The Irishman, a small man standing not over five
feet two or three inches and weighing less than a
hundred and twenty pounds, looked at the two boys
for a full minute before speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be after tellin' me thot they're the byes
what saved Frank," he said at last.
</p>

<p>
"But they are," the captain assured him.
</p>

<p>
Without a word the small man threw his arms
about Bob's neck and gave him a hearty hug at the
same time kissing him on both cheeks.  Then,
releasing him he gave Jack the same treatment.
</p>

<p>
"The store's yer's, the house's yer's, bless me
heart the whale blamed town's yer's, yes wid all uv
Canada throwed in," he cried.  Then turning to the
people who were standing looking wonderingly on,
he shouted: "Did yer hear ut?  These be the byes
whot saved Cap'n Frank whin his ship went down.
What yer standin' thar fer loike a lot uv dummies?
Come up here forninst and shake hands wid 'em
ivery mother's son uv yer."
</p>

<p>
The people needed no second invitation and in
another moment the boys were busy shaking hands
and murmuring their thanks.
</p>

<p>
"Now git out uv here all uv yees an' let me talk
wid me friends," the storekeeper ordered and the
boys were amazed at the meekness and celerity with
which the order was obeyed.
</p>

<p>
"Don't let us interfere with your business," Bob
said.
</p>

<p>
"Interfere nuttin'.  They'll all be back inside an
hour," the man assured him as he led the way back
to one corner of the store which was fitted up as an
office.  "Sit down wid yer an' tell me all about it," he
ordered.
</p>

<p>
Bob gave him an account of the wreck keeping
himself and Jack out of it as much as he could and
when he had finished the storekeeper turned to
Captain Blake and said:
</p>

<p>
"'Tis modest they are as well as brave an' thot's
a mighty good combination let me tell yer.  I've
heard uv thim Canucks down toward Seattle whot
took Frank an' the byes in but I've niver seen 'em.
Believe me, they're goin' ter git a good presint from
old Pete.  Can't yer see I'm busy the minute?"  This
last was shouted at a man who had just come in the
store and was noisily drumming on the counter in an
effort to attract attention.  Without a word he
turned and went out.
</p>

<p>
"You've sure got your customers well trained,
Pete," the captain smiled.
</p>

<p>
"They know better'n ter fool wid me," Pete
grinned.  "Jerry's sick wid a bad cold an' it laves me
all alone in the store," he explained.  "By the way,"
he added as though with a sudden thought, "I wonder
if you bye's are related iny ter a man what was
here a few weeks ago..  His name was the same as
yourn, front name was Silas, Silas Lakewood."
</p>

<p>
"He is our uncle," Bob told him.  "And we've
come up here to find him.  Did you know him?"
</p>

<p>
"I did thot.  He used ter come in a lot an' chin
wid me an' a mighty interstin' chinner he was too, let
me tell yer.  Guess he'd bin about all over the world."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Uncle Silas was a great traveler and the
funny part of it is that we've never seen him."
</p>

<p>
"Is thot so?  It do seem strange.  He's a kinder
queer loike feller too: didn't seem half the time ter
know jest what he did want, but allys seemed ter be
wantin' sumpin'."
</p>

<p>
"Did you know he was going up the Yukon with
a man by the name of Long?" Bob asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Yep, he told me all about it a few days afore he
left an' I did all I could ter keep him from goin'."
</p>

<p>
"Why was that?"
</p>

<p>
"Cause I didn't trust thot man, Long, what was
a goin' wid him, not none I didn't.  But his mind
was made up and thar was no sech thing as changin'
him.  He thought Long was all thot he made hisself
out ter be an' yer couldn't say a word agin him."
</p>

<p>
"But do you know where they were going?  He
wrote father that they would be gone only a month."
</p>

<p>
"An' he told me the same thing an' here he's been
gone, let me see, it must be most three months.  He
told me thot they were goin' up the Yukon as fer as
whar the Koynkuk empties inter it an' thin they
were goin' ter follow thot river up a piece, but he
didn't say jest how fer."
</p>

<p>
"How far is the Koynkuk from here?" Bob asked,
</p>

<p>
"Matter uv 250 or 300 miles more or less."
</p>

<p>
"And he only expected to take a month for the
trip.  It seems to me that that wouldn't leave them
much time to prospect after they got up there."
</p>

<p>
"Jest whot I told him, but he said Long said they
could do ut in thot time an' he sure did trust thot
man worse luck."
</p>

<p>
"What's the score against Long?" Captain Blake
asked.
</p>

<p>
"I dunno thar's anything agin him thot yer could
lay yer finger on, but he's kinder slippery loike an
eel an' I niver did cotton ter him.  He may be all
right, but I'm bettin' he ain't."
</p>

<p>
"Did they take a good store of supplies with
them?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"'Bout enough fer a month I should say."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Pete," Captain Blake said after a short
pause, "the boys want to go after him and it's up to
you to get them a good guide, a man you can trust."
</p>

<p>
"Sure an' it's meself as knows jest the man if he's
at home.  I haven't seen him fer two or three days,
but he's prob'ly round somewhars.  Yer sit here a
minute an' I'll find out."
</p>

<p>
Pete left the store by the front door and was gone
about ten minutes.
</p>

<p>
"Lucky Hogan'll be here in a few minutes," he
announced when he returned.  "He's in town an' it's
three men I sent ter find him."
</p>

<p>
"He's Irish?" Captain Blake asked.
</p>

<p>
Pete laughed.  "Thot's the funny part uv it.
Thar's not a drop uv Irish blood in him: he's pure
Injun: a full blooded Crow."
</p>

<p>
"Then that isn't his real name?"
</p>

<p>
"I dunno.  S'pose not, but it's what iveryone calls
him."
</p>

<p>
"He's reliable?"
</p>

<p>
"Yer don't s'pose I'd sent fer him if he wasn't do
yer?" Pete replied a bit nettled.
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," the captain hastened to assure
him.  "I just asked the question without thinking."
</p>

<p>
"I'd trust Lucky wid me own life an' so would
anyone else what knows him," Pete affirmed.
</p>

<p>
"And you think he'll go?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Sure, but yer'll have ter pay him five dollars a day.
</p>

<p>
"We'll be glad to," Bob assured him.
</p>

<p>
"Why do they call him Lucky?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"I dunno.  He niver's had iny great luck not's
fer's I know."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you can fit them out all right, Pete?"
Captain Blake asked.
</p>

<p>
"Lave ut ter me.  Whin do you want ter start?"
he asked, turning to Bob.
</p>

<p>
"Why, the sooner the better, I suppose.  Let's see,
today's Friday.  Do you think we could get off on
Monday?"
</p>

<p>
"Nuthin' ter prevent fur's I can see."
</p>

<p>
"Is the Yukon froze over yet?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"Sure it is wid five or six inches uv ice on it.  If
it wasn't fer the snow yer could make foine time on
skates, but thar's apt ter be a big snow storm iny
time now."
</p>

<p>
"How cold do you boys think it is now?" the
captain asked.
</p>

<p>
"Must be pretty near down to freezing," Jack replied.
</p>

<p>
Pete laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Did you notice the thermometer when you went
out?" the captain asked.
</p>

<p>
"Ut was ten below."
</p>

<p>
"You mean below zero?" Jack asked doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Sure I do."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it doesn't seem possible.  It must be mighty
dry up here.  It would seem colder than this at that
temperature in Maine and it's pretty dry there."
</p>

<p>
"Wait till it gets fifty below thin yer'll know it's
cold," Pete laughed.
</p>

<p>
"We've seen it forty below in Maine," Bob told him.
</p>

<p>
Just then the front door opened and a man stepped
in and, after looking about for a moment, came over
toward the office.  That he was an Indian there could
be little doubt.  Tall and straight as an arrow his
coal black hair and piercing black eyes gave to him
a dignity which at once caught their attention.  At
the same time there was that about the man which
inspired trust and this they both felt instinctively.
</p>

<p>
"Sam say you want see Injun heap queek," he said
as he stood before them.
</p>

<p>
"An' Sam said jest right, begorra.  Lucky, this is
Cap'n Blake, you've prob'ly seen him, but yer niver
saw these two byes afore an' I want yer should
understand as how they're particular friends uv mine.
They saved Cap'n Frank's life that's what they did."
</p>

<p>
Both boys had risen from their chairs as Pete
started his introduction and now they both held out
their hand with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Injun heap glad know friends of Pete's an' Cap'n
Frank, heem heap fine man.  Injun know heem long
time.  Heem good to Injun."
</p>

<p>
"Now I remember hearing Frank speak of you,"
the captain said as he in turn shook the Indian's
hand.  "It seems rather strange that I've never met
you before."
</p>

<p>
"Cap'n Frank, your brother?" the Indian asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but we don't look much alike."
</p>

<p>
"You heap bigger."
</p>

<p>
"And darker too," the captain added.
</p>

<p>
"Sot yerself, Lucky, an' it's meself as'll tell yer
what we want," Pete said and explained the situation
to him.  "You can go, eh?" he asked when he had
finished.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, Injun go if Pete wants," he said without
hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather trust these byes ter you than ter iny
man I know," Pete said and the boys could see that
the Indian was pleased at the compliment although
he tried not to show it.  "Your dogs in good shape?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"They all right."
</p>

<p>
"Good.  Then you be ready ter start Monday
morning."
</p>

<p>
"Injun be ready."
</p>

<p>
"I'll bet he's a fine fellow," Jack declared as soon
as the Indian had left the store.
</p>

<p>
"Yer can tie ter him," Pete assured them.
</p>

<p>
"He inspires trust," Bob added.
</p>

<p>
"He sure deserves ut too."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Pete, we won't keep your trade away any
longer," the captain said as he got up from his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Thar's no need ter hurry," Pete told them.
</p>

<p>
"Come on board and take dinner with us tomorrow,"
the captain invited.
</p>

<p>
"What time?"
</p>

<p>
"We dine at one o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"Faith an' I'll be thar wid bells on.  Have ter
close up store, but thot don't matter iny."
</p>

<p>
"It is a bit cold," Jack said when they were half
way back to the ship.
</p>

<p>
They had stopped at the telegraph office long
enough to permit the boys to send a wire to their
father telling of their safe arrival and that they had
secured a good guide.
</p>

<p>
"What a man that storekeeper is," Bob remarked
as they walked along.
</p>

<p>
"I told you he was a character," the captain
smiled.
</p>

<p>
"And that Indian," Jack added.  "He may be a
Crow, but here's betting that he's a man and a mighty
good one."
</p>

<p>
"If Pete recommends a man you can bank on it
that he's all right," the captain assured them.  "As
I said awhile ago I remember hearing Frank speak
of him as one of the most trustworthy Indians he
had ever met."
</p>

<p>
"Then I reckon we'll be safe with him," Bob
declared.
</p>

<p>
"As safe as you could be with anyone," the captain
said soberly.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
OFF FOR THE NORTH.
</h3>

<p>
Monday morning dawned bright and clear with
the temperature fifteen below zero.  Late Saturday
night and nearly all day Sunday it had snowed and
nearly eighteen inches were added to the little which
had covered the ground when they had landed.  The
intervening days had been busy ones.  What with
getting everything in readiness for the start and
spending as much time as was possible with Captain
Blake, who seemed loath to let them out of his sight,
their time had been fully occupied.  They had seen
much of Pete Slinger and had come to love the little
Irishman.  And not only that, but their respect for
him grew by leaps and bounds as they had frequent
exhibitions of his wonderful ability along many lines.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if there's anything he can't do," Jack
said after he had seen him put a barrel of flour on
to his shoulder with apparent ease.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what it is if there is," the captain
told him.
</p>

<p>
Pete, on his side, fairly seemed to worship the
boys and there was nothing too much for him to do
for them.
</p>

<p>
The ship was to sail at noon that day and Captain
Blake had said the night before that he was glad as
the place would seem very lonesome to him after
they had gone.
</p>

<p>
It was only a few minutes after seven o'clock and
still dark when they reached the store.  As they
approached they saw a long narrow sled loaded nearly
three feet high with all sorts of packages.  Hitched
single file to it were six dogs who growled ominously
as they came up.
</p>

<p>
"Lucky's on time all right," the captain said as he
mounted the steps.
</p>

<p>
"Those dogs don't seem very much pleased to see
us," Jack declared as he followed close at his heels.
</p>

<p>
"I guess they'll be all right when they get
acquainted," Bob said.
</p>

<p>
"Here yees are," Pete greeted them as the captain
pushed open the door.  "I was jest tellin' Lucky thot
he'd have ter go an' pull yees out uv bed."
</p>

<p>
Everything was all ready for the start and the
good byes were quickly said.  Outside once more
Lucky grasped one of the handles, which stuck out
breast high at the rear of the sled, with one hand
while with the other he swung the long raw hide
whip which cracked with a report like that of a
forty-five.
</p>

<p>
"Mush," he ordered and the dogs started off up
the street while the boys fell in behind.
</p>

<p>
"Good bye an' good luck to yees," Pete shouted.
</p>

<p>
"God keep you," the captain called after them.
</p>

<p>
"Good bye, good bye," the boys called back.
</p>

<p>
Lucky Hogan had explained the night before that
they were to cut across country for a distance of
some 250 miles where they would strike the river at
about the same distance from the coast.  As they left
the town the stars above were just beginning to pale
while in the east a faint glow told of the coming day.
</p>

<p>
"If I go too fast let me know heap soon," Lucky
called back over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"We will that," Jack assured him.
</p>

<p>
Although they had started fairly early several
teams had left ahead of them and the trail was in
fairly good shape.  Nevertheless it was hard traveling
from the start.  The snow was light and dry and
the footing anything but secure, and inside of an
hour they were both puffing hard.
</p>

<p>
"That fellow must think we're used to this all
right," Jack panted, glancing back over his shoulder
at Bob who was a few feet behind.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him he'll have to slow up a bit," Bob suggested.
</p>

<p>
The Indian stopped the team as soon as Jack
called to him and waited for them to catch up.
</p>

<p>
"We go too fast, eh?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Just a little," Jack told him.  "You see, we're a
bit soft and it'll take a few miles to get our muscles
hardened up."
</p>

<p>
"Injun try remember, go slower," he promised.
</p>

<p>
"Hope he doesn't think we're lazy," Bob whispered
as Lucky started up the dogs again after allowing
them to rest for a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
About nine o'clock the sun came up and it began to
warm up a little and soon the boys were forced to
discard their heavy mackinaws.  The country,
through which they were passing, was hilly and Jack
declared that they were going either up hill or down
all the time and he was not far wrong.  About every
hour the Indian stopped the team and allowed the
dogs to rest for some ten minutes and the boys were
glad of the breathing spells.
</p>

<p>
When noon came they halted at the foot of a long
steep hill and ate their lunch which Pete had
provided, washing it down with hot coffee from a
thermos bottle.
</p>

<p>
"How far have we come?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"'Bout twenty mile," the Indian told him.
</p>

<p>
"Gee, is that all?"
</p>

<p>
"No mak' fast time in deep snow."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we've been going fast enough to suit me,"
Bob laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Same here," Jack added.
</p>

<p>
The Indian, before eating, had fed the dogs,
giving each a frozen fish, and they were now lying in
the snow.  Jack, as soon as he had finished, went
toward them thinking that it would be a good time
to get acquainted.  But an ominous growl caused
him to stop and look back inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Better wait," the Indian cautioned him and he
came back.  "Them dog heap bad when them no
know you.  Them know you ver' soon then you touch
um," he explained.
</p>

<p>
"Would they bite me now?"
</p>

<p>
"Plenty apt bite now, not after while."
</p>

<p>
"Then I reckon I'll wait," Jack grinned as he sat
down on the snow beside the trail.  "But, I say,
Lucky, they look like fine dogs."
</p>

<p>
"Them heap best dogs ever was," the Indian replied
proudly.  "They all one litter, oui.  Injun had
der father an' mother, raise um."
</p>

<p>
"How old are they?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Two year come summer."
</p>

<p>
"They're little more that pups then?"
</p>

<p>
"But they ver' strong and heap fast."
</p>

<p>
"I'll bet they are," Jack agreed.
</p>

<p>
"That lead dog heem Lightning an' next
Thunder," the Indian told them.
</p>

<p>
"Those are good names," Bob said.  "What do
you call the others?"
</p>

<p>
"Next one Pete, den Kish, den Slack an' der sled
dog heem Jim."
</p>

<p>
"Did you name that one after Pete Slinger?" Jack
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, heem bon friend to Injun an' Pete heem
ver 'bon dog."
</p>

<p>
"But how about Slack?  Why do you call him
that?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Heem lazy, heem strong like moose, but heem
lik' hang back.  Call heem Slack."
</p>

<p>
"What breed are they?"
</p>

<p>
"Mother was Esquimo dog, heap beeg girl an'
father heem timber wolf."
</p>

<p>
"You mean they're half wolf?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui."
</p>

<p>
"But where did you get him?"
</p>

<p>
"Injun catch um when ver' leetle pup."
</p>

<p>
"But I always thought you couldn't tame a wolf,"
Jack broke in.
</p>

<p>
"No geet ver' fame, but heem know Injun, no
other man touch heem, jest Injun."
</p>

<p>
"Have you got them now?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"No got.  Heem break chain one night, go off an'
no come back.  Mebby geet shot.  She geet seek
ver' soon an' die, seex moons gone."
</p>

<p>
They had met no one all morning, but they were
only about half way up the hill when, almost without
warning, a team swept around a bend in the trail.
Coming down the hill they were traveling fast and,
before Lucky could get his team out of the way, the
two leaders had met.  The boys were some thirty
feet behind the sled and by the time they reached the
scene of action the air seemed, as Jack afterward
declared, full of dogs.  The yelps and growls of the
combatants drowned the voices of the Indian and
the driver of the other team as they shouted orders
to which the dogs paid not the slightest attention.
There were six dogs in the other team and, for a
moment, they seemed well matched so far as the
boys could see, but soon even they could tell that the
strangers were getting far the worst of it.
</p>

<p>
"Our dogs'll kill them," Bob shouted.
</p>

<p>
But the fight was over almost as quickly as it had
started.  The stranger's dogs, evidently realizing
that they were outclassed, soon gave up the combat
and shrank back whining piteously.  Lucky's dogs
did not press their advantage being apparently satisfied
with the result.  But the driver of the beaten
team did not show as good judgment.  He was a
large burly man whose dark skin and high cheek
bones indicated that he was a half breed.  No sooner
had the dogs separated than, with a snarl of rage, he
drew an ugly looking revolver from his belt and
aimed it at Lightning.
</p>

<p>
"Don't shoot him," Jack gasped.
</p>

<p>
Then an amazing thing took place.  Lucky was
about twelve feet from the breed when the latter
drew his gun and, with a movement of his arm
incredibly swift, his whip lash darted out and the end
wrapped itself about the barrel of the revolver.
Another quick movement and the gun was snatched
from the man's hand and sent flying through the air
to fall in the snow twenty feet away.  The entire
scene took place so swiftly that it was all over
before the boys realized what had happened.
</p>

<p>
"Did you see that?" Bob gasped.
</p>

<p>
But before Jack could answer the breed had leaped
for the Indian with a hoarse cry of rage.  The boys
held their breath wondering what was coming next,
but they did not have long to wait.  They had
suspected that the Indian was possessed of great
strength, but what they saw amazed them.  As the
breed rushed toward him the Indian bent his body
slightly to meet the attack and the next instant they
saw the stranger lifted bodily and thrown several
feet to fall sprawling in the snow.
</p>

<p>
"How'd he do it?" Jack whispered.
</p>

<p>
"He did it all right," Bob replied.  "Wonder if
he's had enough."
</p>

<p>
The breed was slowly picking himself up a look
of blank amazement on his face.  First he looked
toward the boys and then turned to Lucky who stood
with a look of calm stoicism on his face.
</p>

<p>
"Better not," he said calmly as the breed took a
step toward him.
</p>

<p>
There was something in the Indian's voice that
gave the other pause for he stopped and, for a
moment stood as though undecided what to do.  Then
he turned and started toward where the revolver had
fallen.
</p>

<p>
"Stop."
</p>

<p>
At the order the breed turned his head but kept on.
</p>

<p>
"Stop."
</p>

<p>
This time he halted and growled:
</p>

<p>
"I'm goin' ter geet my gun."
</p>

<p>
"Injun geet eet," and he sprang from the trail and
a moment later picked the revolver from where it
had fallen in the snow.
</p>

<p>
Removing the cartridges he threw them away and
then, stepping close to the breed, handed him the gun.
For a second it seemed that the breed was about to
jump at the Indian's throat in spite of the lesson he
had already received, but he evidently thought better
of it for he snatched the gun from his hand and,
thrusting it into his belt, turned and went quickly
back to where his dogs were lying in the snow.  Lucky
followed and at his command his dogs rose and soon,
with the help of the boys, the team was out of the
trail enough to permit the other team to pass.  Low
rumbling growls came from the throats of the dogs
of both teams as they passed, but there was no move
toward another attack.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know that fellow?" Bob asked as soon as
the stranger had gotten out of hearing.
</p>

<p>
"Non, heem heap bad man."
</p>

<p>
"He's a heap disagreeable one," Jack added.
</p>

<p>
"But he tackled the wrong customer when he
tackled you," Bob said with an admiring glance at
Lucky.  "That was the prettiest throw I ever saw:
wish you would teach me how to do it."
</p>

<p>
"Oui, Injun show white boy sometime."
</p>

<p>
Lucky examined the harness, but found it had not
been injured during the fight and, at his cry of
"mush" the dogs were off again.
</p>

<p>
"My, what a man," Bob said in a low tone as he
and Jack fell in behind.
</p>

<p>
"And then some," Jack added.
</p>

<p>
"It seems queer," Bob continued.
</p>

<p>
"What seems queer?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Lucky."
</p>

<p>
"But what do you mean queer?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he looks like an Indian and he acts like an
Indian and we have it from no less authority than
the great Pete Slinger that he is an Indian, but he
talks like a Canuck and has an Irish name.  Can you
beat it?"
</p>

<p>
"But he says heap once in a while and just a
minute ago he referred to you as a white boy.  That's
Indian all right."
</p>

<p>
At last they reached the top of the long hill and
the trail dipped down on the other side in an almost
endless reach.  It was four o'clock when they reached
the edge of a thick growth of trees and, as it was
nearly dark, Lucky proposed that they make camp
for the night.  Both boys greeted the suggestion
eagerly for, although they would hesitate to acknowledge
it, they were tired.  Beneath the broad branches
of a giant spruce, which stood just within the edge
of the forest, the ground was nearly bare of snow
and Lucky choose it as a good place.
</p>

<p>
"White boys cut plenty boughs while Indian unpack
stuff," he suggested as he pulled two small, but
sharp axes from beneath the canvas which covered
the load.
</p>

<p>
By the time they had enough of the fragrant
boughs cut to satisfy him, the Indian had the dogs
fed and fixed for the night, what they needed
unpacked and a fire started.
</p>

<p>
"Talk about efficiency," Jack declared as he
brought in his third armful of boughs.
</p>

<p>
"He's it," Bob laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Hope he's as good a cook as he is at other things,"
Jack whispered.
</p>

<p>
"It'll be funny if he isn't."
</p>

<p>
"You mean it'll be a tragedy."
</p>

<p>
But their fears were groundless for in less than an
hour from the time they had reached the woods the
Indian announced that supper was ready.  Venison
steak and potatoes baked in the camp fire constituted
the main part of the meal and both boys declared
that nothing had ever fasted better.  The Indian
seemed pleased at their words of praise and urged
them to eat until both declared that they could not
get another mouthful down.  They washed the dishes
in melted snow water which had been heating in a
large iron kettle set in the hot ashes.
</p>

<p>
It was now pitch dark and a light wind had sprung
up during the last half hour.
</p>

<p>
"You think it's going to storm?" Bob asked a
little later as they sat by the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, Injun 'fraid so."
</p>

<p>
The wind had been increasing slowly, but steadily
and now the moan of the trees, as their tops swayed
to and fro, filled the night.  For an hour or more
they sat by the fire while, at Bob's invitation, the
Indian entertained them with stories of his early life.
He was a good story teller and they listened with
bated breath as he told of one adventure after
another.
</p>

<p>
"Time to sleep now," he finally declared.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon," Bob agreed.
</p>

<p>
"You think it'll snow before morning?" Jack
asked as he got to his feet.
</p>

<p>
The Indian hesitated a moment.  "Wind getting
round Nor East, mean snow," he finally declared.
</p>

<p>
From the sled, which had been left beneath the
branches of another spruce near by, he brought three
sleeping bags, huge canvas affairs, lined with bear
skins and fitted with a flap, which could be drawn
completely over the head, but which was equipped
with air holes so that the sleeper would be able to
breath easily.
</p>

<p>
"We ought to sleep warm in those things," Jack
declared.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, sleep heap warm," Lucky assured them.
</p>

<p>
How long he had been asleep Bob did not know
but, sometime in the night, he awakened with a
sudden start.  For an instant he wondered where he
was and then, as memory returned, he wondered
what had disturbed him for he rarely woke up in the
night unless there was a cause.  But, after listening
intently for a moment and hearing nothing save the
sighing of the trees and an occasional low growl
from one of the dogs, he decided that he had been
mistaken and was about to go to sleep again when,
far off in the forest, he heard a low but distinct howl.
</p>

<p>
"That sounds like a wolf," he thought.
</p>

<p>
And then, from a direction more to the right,
came an answering howl a little louder than the
other.
</p>

<p>
He was lying close to Jack who was between him
and the Indian and, as the second howl rang through
the forest, he felt his brother stir.
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear it?" He asked.
</p>

<p>
"Sure did."
</p>

<p>
"Sounded like a wolf."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I thought."
</p>

<p>
Then came the answer from the first wolf and now
it was apparently much nearer.  Low menacing
growls from the dogs indicated that they too had
heard the ominous sounds.
</p>

<p>
"They're coming this way," Jack declared.
</p>

<p>
"Sounds like it."
</p>

<p>
"Think there's any danger?"
</p>

<p>
"Injun build up fire.  No come ver' near fire."
</p>

<p>
So Lucky also was awake.  Bob had thought it a
bit strange that the Indian had not been awakened
as he knew that most forest bred men were light
sleepers.
</p>

<p>
"Can we help?" he asked as he heard him crawling
out from his sleeping bag.
</p>

<p>
"Non.  Plenty much wood.  Injun feex heem."
</p>

<p>
The fire, as Bob could see from where he lay, had
not entirely died out and, as Lucky had said, there
was plenty of wood, and soon it was blazing up
brightly the fight casting weird shadows.
</p>

<p>
"Wolf no come near fire," the Indian told them as
he crawled back into his bag.
</p>

<p>
"What time is it?  Did you look?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, three o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"Will that fire last till morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Injun keep heem feexed.  White boys go sleep,"
he assured them.
</p>

<p>
"Is it snowing?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, heem snow leetle, not hard&mdash;yet."
</p>

<p>
As they could tell by the sound of the howls the
wolves were coming nearer and, in spite of the Indian's
assurance, the boys were unable to go to sleep
again.
</p>

<p>
"That fellow wasn't far off," Jack whispered a
few minutes later.
</p>

<p>
"Neither was that one," Bob replied.
</p>

<p>
"Hope they know that they're supposed to be
afraid of fire."
</p>

<p>
"Same here."
</p>

<p>
The dogs were getting more and more uneasy as
the wolves came closer and soon the boys heard the
Indian again moving.  He threw some more wood
on the fire and then, going to where the dogs were
stationed, he spoke to them in a low tone as if
fearful that he would awaken the boys.  At his words
the dogs ceased their growls, but a low whining
told that they were not fully reassured.
</p>

<p>
"We're not asleep," Bob called out.
</p>

<p>
"How many of them are there should you say?"
Jack asked as the Indian came back beneath the
tree.
</p>

<p>
"Mebby ten, mebby more."
</p>

<p>
Howl now answered howl in rapid succession as
the wolves came nearer and, a few minutes later
Bob, who was sitting up, thought he could see a
shadowy form on the other side of the fire and some
twenty feet away from it.
</p>

<p>
"Look, Jack," he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"I can't see anything."
</p>

<p>
"Just the other side of that big tree."
</p>

<p>
"I see it now."
</p>

<p>
"Heem no come nearer," the Indian assured him.
</p>

<p>
"How about trying a shot at him?" Bob whispered.
</p>

<p>
But before he could get out of his bag at his
automatic, which was in his belt, the wolf had
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"He saved his hide," Jack said.
</p>

<p>
That the roaring fire had been too much for the
wolves to face was evident as their howls grew;
fainter and fainter and finally died out altogether.
</p>

<p>
"I'm mighty glad they were educated wolves,"
Jack sighed as he snuggled down in his bag.
</p>

<p>
"What you mean, educated?" Bob asked him.
</p>

<p>
"Why, that they were brought up to be afraid of
fire."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
A NORTHERN BLIZZARD.
</h3>

<p>
It was still dark when Bob awoke again, but the
smell of frying bacon, which came to his nostrils as
he raised his head, told him that it was morning and
time to get up.  The wind was blowing hard as he
could tell by the sound of the tree tops and a fine
snow was drifting in even beneath the tree and he
saw that both Jack and himself were nearly buried
in it.
</p>

<p>
"Time to get up," he said giving his brother a
shake.
</p>

<p>
"Huh."
</p>

<p>
"I said it's time to get up," Bob repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, all right," and in another minute Jack had
wiggled out of his bag.  "Gee, it's storming all right,
isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll say it is.  Hear that wind."
</p>

<p>
"Heap beeg snow outside," Lucky declared as they
came close to the fire.
</p>

<p>
"It must be coming down pretty fast," Bob agreed
as he noticed that even in the thick woods several
inches had fallen.
</p>

<p>
"Will it last all day?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Mebby."
</p>

<p>
"But we can keep on just the same?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui, in the woods heem not so bad."
</p>

<p>
"How long'll we be in the woods?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"Fifty, seexty mile."
</p>

<p>
"Then we won't be out today, that's certain."
</p>

<p>
It was eight o'clock when they started and still
dark.  The going was much harder than the day
before as the newly fallen snow made the footing even
more insecure.
</p>

<p>
"We'll be lucky if we make twenty miles today,"
Bob told Jack before they had gone a mile.
</p>

<p>
Although the thick trees sheltered them to a large
extent from the fury of the storm, which had now
nearly assumed the proportions of a blizzard, yet the
sharp particles of snow stung their faces like needles
whenever an open space allowed the wind to reach
them with anything like its full force.  The snow
was also getting deeper and deeper and for the last
half mile the Indian had been breaking trail ahead
of the team.
</p>

<p>
"It must be fierce out in the open," Jack declared
as they paused for a rest shortly after nine o'clock.
</p>

<p>
"Heem heap bad," Lucky agreed.
</p>

<p>
"And it seems to be getting worse instead of
better," Bob added as he glanced up through an open
space between the trees.
</p>

<p>
"It's sure howling some," Jack agreed.
</p>

<p>
"I think you better put on snow-shoe now," Lucky
advised as they were about to start off again.  "White
boys know um?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet," Bob assured him.  "We were raised
in Maine you know and, believe me, they have some
snow up there."
</p>

<p>
"But you can't break trail with snow-shoes on,"
Jack objected.
</p>

<p>
"Non, no can.  Injun no put um on."
</p>

<p>
"Then we're going to take turns at it," Bob declared.
</p>

<p>
"Injun break trail."
</p>

<p>
"Not now, he won't," Bob insisted shaking his
head as Lucky held out a pair of snow-shoes which
he had taken from the pack on the sled.  "You put
them on, I'm going to break trail for awhile."
</p>

<p>
"But Injun&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know, you'd do all the work if we'd let you, but
we're going to do our share," Bob insisted.
</p>

<p>
Seeing that the boy was determined the Indian did
not insist further, but thrust his feet into the straps
and motioned Bob to go ahead.  There was still
enough of the trail left so that he had no trouble in
keeping the path, but it was filling rapidly and in
places the snow was already drifted even across it.
He had expected to find it hard work, but it was
harder than he had thought it would be.  But he
was strong and not afraid of hard work so he kept
at it until Jack sang out that it was his turn.
</p>

<p>
"It's getting pretty hard to see the trail and you'll
have to be careful," he advised as he slipped his
feet into the shoes which Jack had been wearing.
</p>

<p>
"Injun know heem get off trail," Lucky assured them.
</p>

<p>
Bob judged that they had been making about two
miles an hour and the Indian agreed with him when
he mentioned it.
</p>

<p>
"And I reckon we'll go slower before we go
faster," Jack said.  "Just listen to that wind."
</p>

<p>
"Do you suppose those wolves are following us?"
Bob asked the Indian a few minutes later.
</p>

<p>
"Mebby."
</p>

<p>
"I thought I heard one howl just then, but perhaps
it was only the wind."
</p>

<p>
"Injun hear heem."
</p>

<p>
"Are they timber wolves?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui."
</p>

<p>
"Will they attack a man?"
</p>

<p>
"Mebby."
</p>

<p>
"But not likely?"
</p>

<p>
"Them geet a man alone them go for heem, not
likely three mans."
</p>

<p>
Bob was not frightened, but he always liked to
know just what he was up against and he had read
so many stories in which wolves, and especially
timber wolves, had attacked men that he was a bit
worried.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose one could get up in a tree if they should
attack us," he suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, but them no geet us," the Indian assured him.
</p>

<p>
At noon they halted in a sheltered place for dinner
and several times while eating they heard the howls
of the wolves, but they were at some distance and
the Indian assured them that there was no danger.
</p>

<p>
During the afternoon the storm increased in
violence but they kept steadily on breaking trail by
turns in short shifts.  The old tracks had disappeared
sometime ago and the Indian was obliged to
continually shout directions when either of the boys
were in the lead.  In spite of the fact that one or
the other always went ahead of the dogs it was hard
work for them to drag the sled along and at three
o'clock Lucky decided that they had better call it a
day.
</p>

<p>
"Them dog heem ver' tired," he said.
</p>

<p>
"And it's no wonder," Bob agreed.
</p>

<p>
"They got nothing on me at that," Jack declared.
</p>

<p>
Although still early in the afternoon dusk was
already beginning to creep over the forest and they
knew that it would be dark in another hour.
</p>

<p>
As on the previous day the boys cut boughs for
the beds while the Indian attended to the dogs and
started the fire.
</p>

<p>
"We geet heap plenty wood," he told them as soon
as they had brought in enough boughs.  "Fire burn
plenty fast in wind."
</p>

<p>
"You bet we want plenty," Jack agreed.
</p>

<p>
"Enough to entertain all comers," Bob added.
</p>

<p>
"We'll get it while you're getting supper," Jack
told him and the Indian nodded assent.
</p>

<p>
But it was not so easy to keep his promise as he
had thought.  The snow was now so deep that all
the dead underbrush was buried out of sight and
the darkness was rapidly increasing.
</p>

<p>
"Looks kind of dubious," Jack said after they had
been hunting for several minutes.
</p>

<p>
"I'll say it does, but we've got to find some and
that's all there is to it," Bob replied.  "I don't want
those wolves nibbling at my toes tonight."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon they'd nibble more than your toes if they
got that close," Jack declared.  "But here's what we
want so I guess your tootsies are safe."
</p>

<p>
He had found a dead tree almost ready to fall over
and, as he spoke he gave it a shove and down it came.
</p>

<p>
"If it hasn't all gone to punk," Bob said as he
came up.
</p>

<p>
A quick examination proved that, although the
tree had been dead for some time, it was still fit for
firewood and they set to work to cut it up so that
they could drag it to the camp some fifty feet away.
</p>

<p>
"Think this one'll be enough?" Jack asked as he
started off with the butt.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, but we'd better get more if we can."
</p>

<p>
But by the time they had dragged the different
parts of the tree up to where Lucky had started a
fire with some dead branches which he had found
close by, he told them that they had enough.
</p>

<p>
"You sure?" Bob asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"I think so but mebby you find one more."
</p>

<p>
"Come on, Jack," Bob said as he started back.  "I
think I saw another dead one close by that one."
</p>

<p>
It was now so dark that they could see but a few
feet ahead of them and they were obliged to be very
careful with the axes to avoid an accident, but they
finally got the other tree cut up and dragged into
camp.
</p>

<p>
"Now I feel better," Bob declared.
</p>

<p>
"Supper heem ready," came the welcome announcement
just as they were putting away the axes.
</p>

<p>
All that night the storm raged.  Several times
during the night they heard the howls of wolves
above the noise of the storm, but they did not come
very near thanks undoubtedly to the fire which the
Indian kept burning brightly all the time.  It was
eight o'clock when Lucky awoke them to find that
the storm had nearly blown itself out and that
breakfast was ready.  Over a foot more of snow had fallen
and they knew that their progress would be slow that
day.
</p>

<p>
"It's almost as bad as the case of the frog jumping
out of the well," Jack declared as he poured himself
a cup of coffee.
</p>

<p>
"How was that?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Why, every time he jumped up two feet he fell
back three."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we're more'n holding our own and that's
better than he did."
</p>

<p>
Four more days passed and Saturday night came.
In spite of the deep snow they had on the whole made
fairly good time as their muscles were hardening and
they were able to maintain a faster pace.  There had
been no more snow and that which had fallen had
drifted so hard that in most places it held the sled
and dogs though, of course, Lucky and the boys were
obliged to wear snow-shoes.  In view of the fact
that they were on a trip where time might mean a
man's life they had decided that they were justified
in traveling on Sunday although under other
circumstances they would not have considered it.  The
weather had been cold, the thermometer rarely getting
above ten below zero and one morning it had
sunk to thirty below.
</p>

<p>
Each night they had heard the howls of timber
wolves and a number of times they had caught sight
of a slim gray form in the distance.  The knowledge
that the pack was still following them was far from
comforting but, being well armed with both rifles
and revolvers, they had no real fear.
</p>

<p>
Thursday morning Jack had shot a small buck
deer and the meat was a very welcome addition to
their larder as they had brought with them only
enough fresh meat for a couple of days.  Their
respect and liking for the Indian increased every day
for they found him not only abounding in resourcefulness,
but he had proved, as Jack put it, a mighty
likeable fellow.
</p>

<p>
"I always thought Indians were solemn and never
laughed or anything of that sort," he said to Bob
one day as they were some distance behind the sled,
Lucky leading the way.
</p>

<p>
"They usually are more or less that way, but Lucky
can laugh as well as the next fellow."
</p>

<p>
"You bet he can.  Probably it's the way he's been
brought up," Jack suggested.
</p>

<p>
"We heet river one more day," Lucky told them
that night as they were washing up after supper.
</p>

<p>
"You mean we'll be there tomorrow night?" Bob
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Heem 'bout forty mile," Lucky said.
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll make it sure," Jack declared.
</p>

<p>
Besides the Canuck they had encountered their
first day out they had seen but two men and these
they had met the day after the storm.  They had
seemed well disposed Canucks and, learning that
they had come from up the river, they had inquired
if they had seen anything of their uncle.  But neither
of them had.
</p>

<p>
It was just as dusk was beginning to settle the
next day that they came in sight of the river.  For
a couple of miles they had been climbing a gentle
slope, and, as they reached the top, they could see
two rivers about a mile away.
</p>

<p>
"Big one heem Yukon an' leetle one Kayakuk,"
Lucky told them pointing with his hand.
</p>

<p>
"But how do we get down to it?" Bob asked.  "It
looks as though it went off almost perpendicularly
here and it must be a drop of nearly a hundred feet."
</p>

<p>
"Path down off jest leetle way.  Injun show you."
</p>

<p>
Bob was about to turn back when a startled cry
from Jack, who had been standing a few feet nearer
the edge of the hill, made him look around just in
time to see his brother disappear over the edge
together with a vast smother of snow.  For an instant
he was petrified with fear.
</p>

<p>
"He&mdash;he's gone," he gasped.  Then, as reason
returned, he shouted:
</p>

<p>
"Jack!  Jack!"
</p>

<p>
But there was no answer.  The Indian had said
nothing, but Bob could see that he was shaking as
with the palsy.
</p>

<p>
"Where's that pass down?" he shouted.  "Maybe
he's not dead."
</p>

<p>
The question seemed to galvanize the Indian to
action and, leaving the dogs, he led the way a little
to the right where a more gentle descent offered.
</p>

<p>
"White boy be careful," the Indian cautioned as
Bob started down, but he had no thought but to get
to the bottom as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
It was very steep even here and several times he
lost his footing and fell, once turning over three or
four times before recovering himself.  Only one
thought was in his mind&mdash;Jack was in danger, perhaps
dead.  It seemed to the frantic boy that ages
passed before he reached the bottom, but in reality it
was only a few seconds.  The last twenty feet or so
was the steepest and, in his rush, he tripped and
rolled to the bottom.  But he was not hurt and,
quickly picking himself up, he started as fast as he
could go for the place where Jack had gone over.  A
projection cut off his view until he was within a few
feet of the spot.
</p>

<p>
"O, God, don't let him be dead," he prayed as he
hurried along.
</p>

<p>
With his heart in his mouth he rounded the turn
and the next instant a low cry of joy burst from his
lips.  There, not twenty feet away sat Jack rubbing
his eyes as though he had just woke up.  At Bob's
cry he turned.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you come down by the short route?"
he grinned.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God," Bob breathed as he hastened to
Jack's side.  "Jack, boy, I&mdash;I thought you were
killed," he sobbed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, not so you'd notice it," Jack assured him.
</p>

<p>
"White boy sure no hurt?  Heap bad fall."
</p>

<p>
Lucky was standing just behind Bob a look of
intense relief on his face.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I haven't had time yet to take account of
stock, but so far's I know I'm all here."
</p>

<p>
"It's a miracle you weren't killed."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know.  You see, so much snow came
down with me that I lit as light as a feather." Jack
grinned.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you hear me yelling?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"No.  You see I was about six feet more or less
underneath when I landed and about the time you
were yelling I reckon I was pawing my way
surfaceward."
</p>

<p>
"Where are your snow-shoes?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Down below.  I'm afraid they didn't come
through as well as I did."
</p>

<p>
"White boys stay here Injun git team, git shovel."  Lucky
turned and was gone before they had time to
say anything.
</p>

<p>
"Believe me, he was one scared Indian when he
saw you go over that cliff.  Don't ever tell me that
Indians have no feelings or that they never show
them.  If ever I saw fear and sorrow on a human
face if was then."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to have seen him," Jack said as he got to
his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I never want to see it again," Bob assured
him.
</p>

<p>
"And, of course I wouldn't want anything to happen
to bring it there.  I didn't mean that.  Only I've
always thought that Indians never did show their
feelings, you know."
</p>

<p>
It was nearly half an hour before Lucky came
around the bend with the team as he had to go some
little distance before finding a place where he could
get the sled down safely.  Stopping the team he
quickly got a shovel from the stores and in a few
minutes had recovered the shoes.  As Jack had
thought they had not come off as well as he.  One
of the frames was broken and several of the strips
of rawhide had snapped in the other.
</p>

<p>
"Not much bust," the Indian told them as he held
them up.  "Injun got one more pair an' heem feex
dees in queek time tonight."
</p>

<p>
If was almost dark by the time the Indian had
found the extra pair of snow-shoes and they were
ready to start once more.  About a mile up the
smaller river from where it emptied into the Yukon
they had seen a small piece of woods and the Indian
told them that they would make camp there for the
night.
</p>

<p>
"Leetle town 'bout twenty mile up river," Lucky
told them after they had eaten supper and were sitting
around the fire.
</p>

<p>
"What's its name?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Heem name Red Shirt."
</p>

<p>
"Red what?" Jack demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Heem Red Shirt."
</p>

<p>
"Some name."
</p>

<p>
"How big a town is it?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not beeg.  You mean how leetle heem be, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"All right, how little is it?" Bob laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Heem seex mebby seven cabin.  Mebby twenty
Injuns an' Canucks."
</p>

<p>
"Wonder if they have movies there?" Jack smiled.
</p>

<p>
"What heem?"
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you ever see moving pictures?"
</p>

<p>
"What heem?" the Indian asked again.
</p>

<p>
Jack described the moving picture as well as he
was able, but it was evident that the Indian did not
get a very good idea of what he was talking about.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
A NEW KIND OF BED-ROOM.
</h3>

<p>
It was shortly after noon the following day when
they reached the town of Red Shirt.  The half dozen
or so log cabins were huddled closely together at the
foot of a fairly high mountain and the first person
they saw, a huge bulk of a man with a thick shaggy
red beard, wore a shirt of the brightest red.
</p>

<p>
"That must be the shirt," Jack whispered to Bob.
</p>

<p>
"It's red enough anyway," Bob whispered back.
</p>

<p>
The man was standing on the porch of the largest
of the cabins which, somewhat to the boy's surprise,
proved to be a store well stocked with goods.
</p>

<p>
"Howdy," he greeted them as they came to a stop
an front of the store.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do," both boys answered his salutation
while Lucky grunted "how."
</p>

<p>
"Why, eets Lucky Hogan," the man said as he
recognized the Indian who's back had been turned
until he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, it's me," he said holding out his hand which
the other grasped.  "An' them boys dey Bob an'
Jack Lakewood.  Heap fine boys."
</p>

<p>
"Ver' glad know yer," the big man smiled shaking
hands with them in turn.  "Come in where eet be
warm."
</p>

<p>
A huge stove, its sides red hot, in the center of
the room made the heat seem almost stifling to the
boys after the long continued cold outside.
</p>

<p>
"Whar yer go, eh?"
</p>

<p>
They were hardly inside before the man asked the
question.
</p>

<p>
"We hardly know," Bob told him.  "You see, we
are looking for my uncle who came up here ten or
twelve weeks ago and has not been heard from since.
We thought you might have seen him."
</p>

<p>
"Heem name Lakewood?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Silas Lakewood and he was with a man by
the name of Long."
</p>

<p>
"Jeem Long?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not know his first name."
</p>

<p>
"That heem, Jeem," Lucky broke in.  "You know
Jeem," he added turning to the big man.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, I know heem," he replied in a tone which
expressed dislike if not hatred.
</p>

<p>
"Did you see them?" Bob asked a bit impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, I see 'em both."
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember how long ago it was?"
</p>

<p>
"Eet quite some long time, mebby tree month,
mebby only two, I dunno."
</p>

<p>
"They stopped here?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui, two mebby tree day."
</p>

<p>
"And did they say where they were going?"
</p>

<p>
"Non.  They seem have beeg secret.  No tell whar
dey go."
</p>

<p>
"But they went up river?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui."
</p>

<p>
"And you haven't seen or heard from them since?"
</p>

<p>
"Non.  No see, no hear."
</p>

<p>
"What do you know about this man, Long?" Bob
asked after a moment's silence.
</p>

<p>
"Heem no bon.  Heem one bad man."
</p>

<p>
"You mean he's a thief?"
</p>

<p>
"Mebby.  Heem bad man.  No bon."
</p>

<p>
Just then the door opened and a man entered.
</p>

<p>
"Thees Jere Laduc," the storekeeper introduced
him.  "Heem jest come from up river.  Mebby heem
seen 'em."  Then turning to the new-comer he asked:
"Yer see Jeem Long up river, Jere?"
</p>

<p>
The Canuck, a small wiry looking man, with a
smooth face, took off his cap and scratched his head
thoughtfully before answering.
</p>

<p>
"Oui," he said finally.  "I see Jeem Long."
</p>

<p>
"Was there another man with him?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, beeg man."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know his name?"
</p>

<p>
Jere scratched his head again.
</p>

<p>
"I forget.  I hear heem, oui, but no remember."
</p>

<p>
"Was it Lakewood?"
</p>

<p>
"Dat eet, Lakewood."
</p>

<p>
"Where did you see them?"
</p>

<p>
"Eet was 'bout ten mile above Batzahakat."
</p>

<p>
"Is that a town?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui."
</p>

<p>
"How far from here?"
</p>

<p>
"Hunered mile."
</p>

<p>
"And how long ago was it that you saw them?"
</p>

<p>
The breed scratched his head a long time before
answering.
</p>

<p>
"Eet must be two month," he finally concluded.
</p>

<p>
"You know him, this man, Long?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui, heem no bon."
</p>

<p>
There was no hesitation this time.
</p>

<p>
"Testimony seems to be unanimous on that point
at any rate," Jack whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Did he tell you where he was going?" was Bob's
next question.
</p>

<p>
"Non, heem no say."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know if they went north?"
</p>

<p>
"Dunno.  Dey leave early in mornin'.  Me no
see 'em go."
</p>

<p>
"I guess that's about all the information we'll get
here," Bob whispered to Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Looks that way," Jack agreed.
</p>

<p>
The storekeeper invited them to stay over a night
in the settlement but, after a brief conference, they
decided that time was too precious and that they
would push on.  So, after thanking him and purchasing
a few things they needed, they said good bye
and started off up the river.  Altogether they had
stopped an hour and, although they had learned
nothing which was very definite except that their
uncle had really been there, somehow the boys felt
slightly encouraged.
</p>

<p>
"Evidently that man Long's a bad egg," Jack
said as they trudged out of the village.
</p>

<p>
"Everyone seems to think so," Bob agreed.
</p>

<p>
"The inhabitants of this burg seem to keep pretty
close indoors," Jack remarked just as they struck
the river.
</p>

<p>
"Them eat dinner now," Lucky told him.
</p>

<p>
On the river the traveling was good and they made
twenty-five miles before camping for the night.
</p>

<p>
"River tak' heap beeg bend leetle way above here
an', in the mornin' we go east, cut off mebby twenty
mile," the Indian told them.
</p>

<p>
For the past three days they had heard nothing
from the wolves and both boys hoped that they had
given up following them.  Lucky shrugged his
shoulders when Bob mentioned it as if to say that
it did not matter to him one way or the other.
</p>

<p>
"Any fish in this river, Lucky," Jack asked as
soon as they had cut the wood for the night.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, heap beeg salmon.  Some trout."
</p>

<p>
"Suppose I could catch one through the ice?"
</p>

<p>
"Dunno, mebby."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've got a hook and line and I'm going to
make a stab at it.  Fresh fish won't go bad."
</p>

<p>
They were camping in a clump of woods just a
few yards from the river and, taking one of the
axes, Jack was soon cutting a hole in the ice.  This
took longer than he had thought for the ice was
nearly eighteen inches thick and it was pretty dark by
the time he was ready to drop in his hook which he
had baited with a piece of pork.
</p>

<p>
"Hope they like pork," he said to himself as he
dropped in the hook.
</p>

<p>
His hope was quickly realized for before the bait
had sunk more than five or six feet he felt a strong
yank and pulled in a trout nearly fifteen inches long.
Quickly he rebaited the hook and dropped it back
through the hole.  This time he had to wait a little
longer, but inside of twenty minutes he had landed
three more trout and two salmon of about five
pounds weight each.
</p>

<p>
"Not bad for the first time," he chuckled as he
strung them together on a bit of line which he found
in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Yer catch um feesh?" Lucky asked as he came
whistling up in the gathering darkness.
</p>

<p>
"What did I go after?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Feesh."
</p>

<p>
"Well, when I go after fish, fish is what I bring
back.  Ask Bob if you don't believe it."  And he held
up the string in the light of the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Yer catch um," Lucky declared.
</p>

<p>
"He always does," Bob assured him.  "That boy
could catch fish in a water bucket."
</p>

<p>
Soon the two salmon were sizzling in the frying
pan and they proved a very welcome addition to
their fare.
</p>

<p>
The next morning they were up early and just as
day was breaking, they left the river and struck off
due east.  The sun came up thickly overcast and
Lucky gave it as his opinion that it would snow
before noon.
</p>

<p>
"You're a good weather prophet, Lucky," Jack
said when, a little after ten o'clock, the first flakes
began to fall.
</p>

<p>
There was no wind and the snowflakes at first
drifted lazily to the earth as if in no hurry to get
there.  Soon they were coming in greater abundance
and, although there was still no wind, the boys
noticed that the Indian was casting an anxious eye
toward the sky.
</p>

<p>
"You think it's going to be a bad storm?" Jack
asked him.
</p>

<p>
"No wind all right.  Wind heem begin blow be
heap bad.  No woods for many mile."
</p>

<p>
"Well, the snow has held off for a good while for
this time of year so I suppose we ought not to kick
if we do get it now," Bob said philosophically.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon it's going to blow some at least," Jack
said an hour later as he felt a slight breeze fan his
face.  "Those flakes aren't coming down straight
any more."
</p>

<p>
It was snowing hard and there was a fairly strong
breeze when they stopped for dinner at twelve o'clock
although it was not yet strong enough to cause the
snow to sting.
</p>

<p>
"About how far from here is there a piece of
timber," Bob asked as they were getting ready to
start off again.
</p>

<p>
"Mebby twenty mile, mebby leetle more."
</p>

<p>
Enough snow had already fallen to make it hard
going and within an hour they were taking turns
breaking trail for the dogs.  The wind was steadily
increasing in force and the snow showed no sign of
abatement.
</p>

<p>
"We'll never make that woods tonight at the rate
we're going," Jack declared.
</p>

<p>
"Non, we no mak' heem.  We look for bon place
mak' camp.  Heem goin' blow heap hard soon."
</p>

<p>
Lucky was right again for they had not been
traveling an hour before the wind had risen to the
force of a gale and was driving the sharp particles
of snow against their faces with stinging violence.
</p>

<p>
"Whew, but this is work," Jack panted as he came
back from breaking trail to allow Lucky to take his
turn.
</p>

<p>
"I'll say you're right," Bob agreed.
</p>

<p>
It was impossible to see more than a few feet
ahead and it was a mystery to the boys how the
Indian could keep a straight course especially as the
wind seemed to change its direction frequently.  But
he seemed sure of his way and the boys had no reason
to doubt his judgment.
</p>

<p>
By half past two the dogs began to show signs of
distress and the Indian gave it as his opinion that
they had better stop.
</p>

<p>
"No must keel um dog," he declared.
</p>

<p>
"I'll say we mustn't, but how are we going to
camp here in the open?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Injun show white boys."
</p>

<p>
All day they had been traveling over a flat country
and there was not even a hill to give them the slightest
protection.  Still they felt sure that Lucky knew best
and if he said camp why, camp it was.
</p>

<p>
"We mak' um house," he said as he pulled the
shovels from the sled.  "We sleep all right, but have
eat cold supper, no got wood."
</p>

<p>
The prospect was anything but pleasant, but the
boys were not unused to hardships and there was
no grumbling as they set to work digging a hole
in the snow under directions from the Indian.
</p>

<p>
"Mak' heem 'bout eight feet long an' seex wide,"
he told them, as he turned to care for the dogs.
</p>

<p>
There was now about four feet of snow on the
level, and, as the old snow was packed down very
hard, it took them some little time to complete the
task.
</p>

<p>
"Reckon it'll drift in about as fast as we can shovel
it out," Jack grumbled as he threw out the last few;
shovelfuls of snow.
</p>

<p>
"Then we can have the pleasure of shoveling it
out again," Bob laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you'd laugh if you were going to be
hanged."
</p>

<p>
"Not quite that bad, but might as well laugh as
cry, you know."
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Lucky's thoughtfulness in bringing
along a small alcohol stove they were able to make
coffee which made the supper seem a little more
cheerful.
</p>

<p>
"What about the dogs?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Dog all right.  No mind snow if not too tired,"
the Indian assured them.
</p>

<p>
It was only a little after four o'clock when they
finished supper, but it was already dark.  Not that it
made so much difference, as Jack declared, seeing
that the snow was coming down so fast that they
could only see a short distance anyhow.
</p>

<p>
"You shovel um out again and we feex roof,"
Lucky said as soon as the meal was finished.
</p>

<p>
"What you going to make a roof out of?" Jack
asked.
</p>

<p>
"I show white boy.  You geet snow out."
</p>

<p>
The snow was already several inches deep in the
dugout, as Jack called it, but they made short work
of it and finished just as the Indian dragged up a
piece of canvas about twelve feet long and eight
wide.
</p>

<p>
"I see what our roof's to be now," Jack laughed.
</p>

<p>
When spread over the dugout the canvas overlapped
about three feet on each side and on it they
shoveled snow, stamping it down good and hard with
their feet.
</p>

<p>
"Now heem hold some snow," the Indian declared
when they had two feet or more of hard packed
snow on either end.
</p>

<p>
"But it won't hold up all night if it keeps up like
this," Bob said doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"We clean heem off one two time, mebby."
</p>

<p>
"Mebby is right," Bob laughed.
</p>

<p>
It was very cold, but after they had crawled info
the dugout and into their sleeping bags they were
plenty warm.
</p>

<p>
"If we only could have gotten some boughs," Jack
complained.  "This ground was laid hard side up."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to be thankful that you've got any
ground to lie on," Bob told him.
</p>

<p>
"Is that intended for a joke?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought there was no ground for it."
</p>

<p>
"Smarty."
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't blame me.  I was born that way, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"Just hear that wind," Bob said a few minutes
later.  "I can't help feeling sorry for the poor dogs
outside."
</p>

<p>
"Them dog all huddle up together.  Keep um all
warm," Lucky assured them.
</p>

<p>
"But they'll be buried before morning," Jack objected.
</p>

<p>
"Sure, snow heap warm.  No mind that."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm glad to know that they won't suffer.
It's snug as a bug in a rug in here," Jack declared.
</p>

<p>
"How about a story, Lucky?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
For more than two hours, while the storm howled
and blew outside, the Indian entertained them with
wonderful stories of the North Land.  He was a
splendid story teller in spite of his broken English
and they could hardly believe it when he announced
that it was nearly eight o'clock and time they were
asleep.
</p>

<p>
"Injun shovel off snow an' den we go sleep," he
said as he wiggled out of his bag.
</p>

<p>
"Is it snowing as hard as ever?" Bob asked when
he slid back into the dugout.
</p>

<p>
"Heem come down heap hard."
</p>

<p>
"Guess we'll have to hole up here for the rest of
the winter," Jack said.
</p>

<p>
"Not so bad if we could sleep all the time," Bob
laughed.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the hard ground they were soon fast
asleep.  Bob awoke some hours later and felt the
Indian moving at his side.
</p>

<p>
"Anything wrong?" he whispered
</p>

<p>
"Injun shovel off snow one time more.  Roof
heem sag some," Lucky whispered back.
</p>

<p>
Reaching up with his hand Bob could tell that
the roof was indeed sagging.
</p>

<p>
"Let me go this time," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Non, Injun no mind eet."
</p>

<p>
Bob was asleep when the Indian returned and did
not hear him.  Some time later he dreamed that he
was lying at the foot of a high precipice.  Overhead,
jutting out from the top of the cliff, hung a
volume of snow which he knew was about to fall on
him.  And yet he was unable to move try as he
might.  He could see the immense mass, slowly
slipping at first, and then gathering speed as it
approached.  He wondered why it did not fall more
rapidly.  It seemed to take a fearful long time
getting down, but, finally it was just above his head
and he closed his eyes as he realized that he would
be buried in another instant.  Then it struck.
</p>

<p>
"What the Sam Hill!" he heard some one say
in tones which sounded far off.
</p>

<p>
"Roof heem fall in," another voice answered.
</p>

<p>
Realizing at last that he was awake and that his
dream had, in a measure, come true almost before
it was over, he began to paw his way out.  But the
others were also pawing and soon they were all
tangled up in a mass of canvas and snow.
</p>

<p>
"Wait till I get my bearings, you fellows," he
shouted.
</p>

<p>
"Get 'em quick then or I'll suffocate," Jack
gasped.
</p>

<p>
After what seemed an interminable time, and
during which Jack urged him to hurry, he succeeded in
getting hold of an edge of the canvas and crawling
out from beneath it Then he quickly pulled it from
off the others and soon they were all standing up.  It
was still snowing hard and the wind seemed to be
blowing hard as ever.
</p>

<p>
"Some spill, that," Jack declared.
</p>

<p>
"Spill is right," Bob agreed.
</p>

<p>
"Heap lot snow," Lucky added.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what'll we do?" Jack asked after a
moment's pause.
</p>

<p>
"What time is it?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Half past five."
</p>

<p>
"Better dig out and fix the roof again, hadn't we?"
Bob proposed.
</p>

<p>
"What do you say, Lucky?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui, better do."
</p>

<p>
It was very dark, but they had flashlights with them
and by their aid they quickly located the shovels in
one corner of the dugout and the two boys fell to
work while the Indian busied himself getting the
strip of canvas straightened out.
</p>

<p>
It took the better part of an hour to get their
home cleaned out and the roof on again, but it was
finally accomplished and they were once more, as
Jack put it, stowed away again.  None of them were
inclined to sleep so they fell to discussing the
situation.
</p>

<p>
"Will it pay to start out while it's storming?" Bob
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Non.  Eet too hard on dog," the Indian told
them.
</p>

<p>
"To say nothing of the effect on us," Jack
chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"But we can't stay here forever," Bob objected.
</p>

<p>
"Wind, heem changing.  Snow stop leetle while."
</p>

<p>
"Hope you're right," Jack said.
</p>

<p>
"Which he usually is," Bob put in.
</p>

<p>
And this time was no exception to the rule for,
shortly before seven o'clock, the Indian, after sticking
his head out, declared that it was only snowing a
"leetle" and that the wind was dying down.
</p>

<p>
"We geet hot coffee an' a bite an' den we start, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"So say we all of us," Jack sang.
</p>

<p>
Their progress that day was distressingly slow to
the boys who were ever fearful that, if they found
their uncle at all, it would be too late.  But they were
obliged to consider the dogs.  They were willing to
do all that could be asked of them, but there was a
limit to their endurance and dragging the heavily
loaded sled through the deep snow was no easy task.
Still, as Jack put it, they were more than holding
their own and, about four o'clock they came to woods
and here they decided to make camp, cheered by
Lucky's assurance that they would reach the town
the next day.
</p>

<p>
They had brought the rest of the fish Jack had
caught, with them and how good a hot meal did
taste.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, you never appreciate a thing till you
have to do without it," Bob declared as he readied
for his third helping.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
TIMBER WOLVES.
</h3>

<p>
The town of Batzahakat is very much like Red
Shirt.  A few log cabins, one of which serves as a
store, huddled together on the bank of the river.  It
was growing dark when two very tired boys and six
nearly played out dogs and an Indian, who acknowledged
that he had been more rested, dragged themselves
up the bank and made their way along the
single short street to the store.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know the man who keeps the store?"
Bob had asked the Indian earlier in the day.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, Injun know heem.  Heem name Jules
Lamont.  Heem Frenchman, no breed," Lucky told
them.
</p>

<p>
"Is he all right?" Bob had asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, heem bon man," Lucky had assured them.
</p>

<p>
And now they soon found that he was again right
for, as soon as they had entered the store, Jules
Lamont gave them a hearty welcome and assured
them that he had plenty of room for them in his
cabin just out behind.
</p>

<p>
Jules Lamont had a wife who was fully as kind
in her welcome as was he and she was a splendid
cook as they soon learned.
</p>

<p>
"Gee, but it seems kind of good to get into a bed
once more," Jack said when, soon after supper, their
host had shown them to a well furnished room above
the living room.  There were two beds in the room
and Lucky occupied the other.
</p>

<p>
Yes, he remembered Silas Lakewood very well
and the man Long as well, he told them the next
morning when, while eating breakfast, they told him
of their errand.
</p>

<p>
"They stay here three four days," he told them in
almost perfect English.
</p>

<p>
"Did they say where they were going?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"They say they go up river, but not how far."
</p>

<p>
"And you haven't seen them since?"
</p>

<p>
"Not since."
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember just how long ago it was they
were here?" was Bob's next question.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty hard say.  Time goes ver' slow up here
an' I forget.  Mebby seven weeks, mebby eight or
nine, but no more than nine sure."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know Long?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, I know him long time."
</p>

<p>
"What kind of a man is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Not good.  I not trust him."
</p>

<p>
"He's sure got a bad reputation," Jack said.  "We
haven't heard a single good word about him yet."
</p>

<p>
"After breakfast over we go see some other men
an' ask them what they know," Jules told them.
</p>

<p>
He had urged them the night before to stay over
a day and they had agreed after Lucky had assured
them that a day's rest would be of great benefit to the
dogs and that they would more than make up for
the lost time.
</p>

<p>
"One day geeve snow time to settle an' mak' more
bon goin'," he assured them.
</p>

<p>
By noon they had interviewed probably nearly
everyone in the village, Jules going with them and
introducing them.  They found the people universally
courteous and eager to be of service, but they
learned no more than they already knew.  It was
evident that neither their uncle or Long had confided
in anyone, keeping their destination a secret.
</p>

<p>
The next morning they got an early start.  Although
it would be several hours before the sun
would make its appearance, it was not dark as the
moon was full.  The dogs had indeed profited by
their day's rest and had fully recovered their eagerness
or pep as Jack put it.  It was twenty-five degrees
below zero when they drove off after thanking their
host and hostess for their kindness.
</p>

<p>
"We ver' glad to have you an' hope you find your
uncle all right an' hope you stop longer time on way
back," Jules Lamont told them as he shook hands.
</p>

<p>
"We'd sure like to and will if we can," they assured him.
</p>

<p>
"He's a mighty fine man," Bob said as soon as
they were out of the village.
</p>

<p>
"And his wife's a queen if there ever was one,"
Jack added.
</p>

<p>
"If you've got any more friends like them up this
way just lead us to them," Bob told Lucky.
</p>

<p>
"Jules, heem best, but they some others," Lucky
said.
</p>

<p>
Their way now lay straight up the river and, as
the snow had settled, they were able to make better
time especially as they found that two or more teams
had been ahead of them and broken a fairly good
trail.
</p>

<p>
They had been traveling for about three hours and
the sun was just beginning to show itself when Jack,
who was walking slightly ahead of the Indian, turned
to ask him a question.  Instead of answering him,
to his surprise Lucky grabbed up a handful of snow
and the next instant he was vigorously rubbing
Jack's nose with it.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, there, what's the b-b-big idea?" he sputtered.
</p>

<p>
"White boy hold still."
</p>

<p>
"Like f-f-fun I w-w-will.  I-I-I want t-to know&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't get excited, Jack," Bob laughed.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Your nose was freezing."
</p>

<p>
"Freezing nothing.  I didn't feel a thing," Jack
retorted.
</p>

<p>
"And that's just what the trouble was.  But I
reckon you can feel it now."
</p>

<p>
"I'll say I can.  It hurts."
</p>

<p>
"That's the frost coming out of it.  It'll be all
right after a bit," Bob assured him.
</p>

<p>
"Jack have heap bad nose, Injun no rub heem,"
Lucky explained.
</p>

<p>
"And I'm much obliged," Jack grinned realizing
now that the Indian had indeed done him a good
turn.
</p>

<p>
They were two days making the next town about
eighty miles farther north.  This was Arctic City, so
called because of being situated exactly on the Arctic
Circle.  The weather had held clear and cold and
they had made good time and were in good spirits as
they entered the town about three o'clock.  Although
only the middle of the afternoon it was dark enough
for lights in the cabins.  Indeed there was only about
five hours a day during which the sun was above the
horizon.
</p>

<p>
Arctic City much resembled the other towns
through which they had passed and they found the
people much the same type.  They were kindly received
and secured a comfortable room for the night.
During the evening they interviewed several of the
men of the place most of whom were known to the
Indian.  But it was just as they were about to start
off the next morning that they received their first
real clue.
</p>

<p>
The dogs were harnessed and Lucky had already
given the order to "Mush" when a very small man
dressed in a heavy bearskin coat shouted to them to
wait a minute.
</p>

<p>
"Wonder what he wants," Bob said as Lucky ordered
the dogs to stop.
</p>

<p>
"Reckon we'll know in a minute," Jack told him.
</p>

<p>
"Yer lookin' fer two mans, eh?" the little man
asked as he came puffing up.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Bob told him.  "Can you give us any
information regarding them?"
</p>

<p>
"Mebby.  What der name?"
</p>

<p>
"Silas Lakewood is one and the other is a man
named Long."
</p>

<p>
"Oui, I see 'em."
</p>

<p>
"When?" Bob asked the question with much
eagerness in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"'Bout seex week ago."
</p>

<p>
"And where did you see them?"
</p>

<p>
"Een Mountain nor' of Beaver."
</p>

<p>
"Where is Beaver?" Jack broke in.
</p>

<p>
"'Bout feefty mile nor' here."
</p>

<p>
"And how far from Beaver are the mountains?"
</p>

<p>
"'Bout same."
</p>

<p>
"Please tell us what you knew."
</p>

<p>
"Oui.  'Bout seex week ago me go up dar hunt
bear.  No find heem an' stay long time, ten day,
mebby two week.  Go round ver' mooch.  One day I
see leetle cabin an' smoke come out heem.  I been
dar before an' never see cabin so I know heem new.
I go up an' go to knock on door when I hear mad
man talk.  I leesten an' hear heem say 'you sign
dat paper or you no go away from here.  I leesten
an' hear nodder man say, 'I no sign heem'.  Den
odder man heem sware ver' mooch an' I come away.
I think eet not my beeseness an' I stay mebby I geet
hurt."
</p>

<p>
"But what makes you think they were the men we
are after?" Bob asked when he had finished.
</p>

<p>
"I hear one man call odder dat name, Lakewood,"
the man told them.
</p>

<p>
"Then I reckon they were the men all right," Bob
said turning to Jack and Lucky.
</p>

<p>
"No doubt about it," Jack agreed while the Indian
nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"And do you think they are still there?" Bob
asked.
</p>

<p>
"I dunno 'bout that.  I come away: no see 'em any
more."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know where that place is?" Bob asked
turning to Lucky.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, I been there."
</p>

<p>
"And you think you can find that cabin?"
</p>

<p>
Instead of replying the Indian turned to the small
man and asked: "You tell me where heem be, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Dar two beeg mountain up dar.  You know heem?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui."
</p>

<p>
"Cabin right 'tween 'em 'bout half way een."
</p>

<p>
"Bon.  I find heem."
</p>

<p>
Bob pulled a five dollar bill from his pocket and
offered it to the man, but he shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Please take it," Bob urged.  "Your information
is worth a lot to us and I want to make you a little
present.  Just take it and buy yourself something."
</p>

<p>
After a little hesitation the man accepted the bill
thanking Bob with a great display of feeling.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it looks as though we had something
definite to go on now," Jack declared as soon as they
were once more on the river.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know that man?" Bob asked the Indian.
</p>

<p>
"Non."
</p>

<p>
"You never saw him before?"
</p>

<p>
"Non."
</p>

<p>
"Then we don't know whether he was telling the
truth or not."
</p>

<p>
"But why would he lie to us?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know unless it was to get some money."
</p>

<p>
"But he didn't want to take it."
</p>

<p>
"He didn't seem to you mean."
</p>

<p>
"Well, maybe, but he looked honest to me."
</p>

<p>
"And he did to me too.  What do you think, Lucky?"
</p>

<p>
"I think heem straight."
</p>

<p>
"Then I reckon it's all right.  We'll take it for
granted anyhow until we find out to the contrary."
</p>

<p>
Greatly to their disappointment they got no more
information in the little village of Beaver which they
reached late that night.  No one seemed to have seen
the men although they found several who said that
they knew Long, but none of them had seen him for
more than a year.
</p>

<p>
"Looks as though they had given this burg the
go-by," Jack said when they were in the little room
which they had secured for the night.
</p>

<p>
"It does look that way," Bob agreed.  "I wonder
why?"
</p>

<p>
"Probably too near the scene of their operations."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe."
</p>

<p>
"But the farther north we go the worse that man
Long's reputation seems to get."
</p>

<p>
"He must be a bad egg for a fact.  He's certainly
not popular."
</p>

<p>
They camped the next night at the beginning of
the pass which led between the two mountains which
reared their snowy summits far up toward the sky.
</p>

<p>
"Cabin not more'n 'bout two mebby three mile
from here," Lucky told them as he halted the team.
It was only two o'clock, the place not being so far
from the town as they had thought from what the
little Frenchman had told them.  Lucky had told
them when starting out that morning that he thought
the man was mistaken as to the distance but, as he
had not been there for a number of years, he was
not sure.
</p>

<p>
They had found a splendid place for a camp.
Beneath an overhanging rock, the ground was almost
free from snow as a circle of thick spruce trees in
front and about twenty feet away had protected it on
the open side.  Here they made beds of thick spruce
boughs and a roaring fire soon warmed the face of
the rock by its reflection so that it seemed impossible
that the temperature outside was nearly forty below.
Before leaving the river early the preceding day,
they had stopped long enough to cut a hole in the ice
and allow Jack to catch a dozen large trout and five
or six salmon, enough, as Bob said, to last them a
couple of weeks.
</p>

<p>
After supper was over they sat for some time in
front of the fire and discussed plans for the morrow.
</p>

<p>
"We got be ver' careful," Lucky told them.  "Dat
man, Long, heem bad man an' heem get mad he
shoot, oui."
</p>

<p>
"But we'll be three against one, not counting
Uncle Silas," Jack reminded him.
</p>

<p>
"But heem got gun an' bullet go ver' fast."
</p>

<p>
"Lucky's right, Jack," Bob declared.  "We must
play it safe.  Of course there may not be any trouble
and everything may be all right and I sure hope it is
but if he's keeping Uncle up here against his will, the
way it looks, he's probably playing for big stakes."
</p>

<p>
"But why should he want to keep him up here?"
</p>

<p>
"That's what we've got to find out.  According
to what that man said he was trying to get him to
sign some paper.  Now, if that's right, my guess is
that they've found gold and he was trying to get him
to sign away his rights to it.  Of course, that's only
a guess."
</p>

<p>
"Heem ver' bon guess," Lucky added.
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't make a better myself," Jack assured him.
</p>

<p>
"Then I'm flattered," Bob smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Then what do you think we'd better do?" Jack
asked, turning to the Indian.
</p>

<p>
"I tink you better stay here an' Injun go up see
what doin'."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think it would be better for me to go?"
Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"White boy no know way," Lucky objected.
</p>

<p>
"But I couldn't help finding it if it's between these
mountains.  You see, it's this way.  That man Long
knows you and if he should see you he'd smell a
mouse, but he's never seen me."
</p>

<p>
Although the Indian saw the force of the argument
and made many objections to the plan he finally
gave in and it was settled that as soon as it was light
enough to see Bob should start to spy out the land.
</p>

<p>
That night, for the first time in several days, they
heard wolves, but they were far off and Lucky did
not think that they had scented them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p117"></a>
"White boy be heap careful," was Lucky's parting
word the next morning, as Bob started off just as it
was beginning to get light.  It was nearly ten o'clock
and he had waited impatiently several hours for the
time to start.  Besides his automatic he took with
him a 38 Remington with which he was an expert
shot.  It was his favorite rifle and he was very choice
with it.  More than one buck had fallen before it in
the woods of Maine and once it had brought down a
large moose.  With it he felt safe.
</p>

<p>
Although he could hardly believe it the thermometer
said forty below when he left the camp, but so
clear and dry was the air that it hardly seemed cold
at all.
</p>

<p>
The passage between the mountains was very narrow,
in fact, there was hardly any level ground between
them, one seeming to rise at the foot of the
other, so he had little fear of missing the cabin
provided it was really there.  The dry snow creaked
pleasantly beneath his snow-shoes as he strode along
humming a favorite song.  Tall trees grew so closely
together that he was unable to keep to anything like
a straight course, but this gave him no worry.  He
had the day before him and there was no hurry.
</p>

<p>
He had gone perhaps three quarters of a mile
when he was brought up short by a long drawn out
howl, seemingly not very far away.
</p>

<p>
"That was a timber wolf," he thought as he peered
anxiously through the trees.
</p>

<p>
The howl was answered almost immediately from
the side of the other mountain and, for a moment, he
wondered if he would not be wise to turn back.
</p>

<p>
"I don't belive ther's more than two of them," he
thought as he listened.
</p>

<p>
But even as the thought passed through his mind
a third howl broke the stillness and this one was
surely behind him.
</p>

<p>
"Seem to have me surrounded," he muttered, as he
started on again.
</p>

<p>
Whether there were more than three of the wolves
he was unable to tell, but that they were coming
nearer there was no doubt.  Soon, peering through
an opening in the trees, he caught sight of a skulking
gray shape just as it raised its head and sent its
mournful howl through the forest.  But that howl
was its last for, before it was finished, he had raised
his rifle and sent a bullet crashing through its head.
The wolf dropped in its tracks, gave a convulsive
kick or two and was still.
</p>

<p>
"One less anyhow," Bob muttered as he ran
forward to where the wolf was stretched.
</p>

<p>
About ten yards from where he was standing was
a large tree with low branches and, as another howl
rang out not hundred yards away, he ran toward it
resolved to make a stand there knowing that wolves
could not climb a tree and that, if worst came to
worst, he could find temporary safety at least in its
branches.
</p>

<p>
By this time he knew that there were more than
three of the beasts and, by the sounds he judged that
there must be nearly a dozen.  Soon he caught sight
of another gray form and, quickly raising his rifle,
fired his second shot.  The wolf fell but, almost
before he was stretched on the snow, from all sides,
gray shapes sprang upon him and in an incredibly
short time the dead wolf was torn in pieces and
devoured.  A moment later and the first one killed
was discovered and had shared a like fate.  And
still the ravenous beasts were not satisfied and in less
than ten minutes from the time he had fired the second
shot the pack was gathered in a semi-circle about
twenty-five feet away, snapping and snarling and
gradually closing in.  He had not fired again hoping
that they would be satisfied with the feast already
provided and go away.  But their appetite seemed
only to be whetted and he fired again.
</p>

<p>
"Here's where little Bobby seeks safer quarters
while they're busy," he muttered as he swung himself
up onto the lowest branch of the tree.  "I imagine
Jack and Lucky'll hear the rumpus and come to my
rescue," he thought.  "Anyhow I'm safe enough and
can pick them off at my leisure, if they choose to stay
around."
</p>

<p>
The third wolf was quickly dispatched and the
pack, about fifteen in number were soon gathered
beneath the tree voicing their disappointment in
mournful howls.  Taking careful aim at the largest
beast he pulled the trigger but, to his surprise, only
a slight click resulted.  Thinking there might be a
defective cartridge in the rifle he pulled back the
ejector.  But to his dismay it stuck when half way
back.
</p>

<p>
"Now I am in a fix," he said half aloud.  "Mighty
funny the thing had to stick at just this time
especially when it's never done it before."
</p>

<p>
All this time he had been working feverishly in
an effort to remove the cartridge, but he soon found
that, without the aid of a screwdriver, it could not
be done.
</p>

<p>
Then the thought that he had his automatic came
to him and he took new heart.  But his joy was short
lived for the revolver was gone.  He couldn't
understand it, he told himself over and over again.  He
distinctly remembered shoving it into place in his belt
just before starting.  Then he remembered that, a
short time before he heard the first wolf, he had
tripped and fallen headlong.
</p>

<p>
"It must have dropped out when I fell," he told
himself.  "Wouldn't I have been in a nice fix if there
had been no trees anywhere around?"  And he shuddered
as he looked down at the hungry beasts only a
few feet beneath him.
</p>

<p>
He knew that he was safe so far as the wolves
were concerned, but the intense cold was beginning
to work through his clothing.  Hustling along on
snow-shoes at forty below zero was one thing, but
roosting up in the branches of a tree at the same
temperature was quite another, he told himself.  He
wondered why Jack and Lucky had not put in an
appearance and then, for the first time he noticed
that a strong wind was blowing and that it was
coming from the direction of the camp.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps that wind's so strong that they haven't
heard the wolves or the shots," he thought.
</p>

<p>
It seemed that his last thought must be correct for
a full hour passed and there was no sign of his
friends.  He knew it would be of no use to shout for
if they had not heard the wolves and his shots it was
dead certain that they would not hear him.  If they
had heard anything to give them the idea that he
might be in trouble they would have had no trouble
in following his tracks as they were the only ones
visible.  Hence, he reasoned, they had heard nothing.
He did not know whether it was growing colder or
not, but he was quite sure that he was, and,
having a firm seat in a crotch, he spent much of the
time beating his body with his arms in an effort to
keep out as much of the cold as possible.
</p>

<p>
The wolves showed no signs of giving up.  To be
sure they were no longer leaping and howling, but
had assumed an attitude of what he called watchful
waiting.  It was, he knew, only a question of being
able to stand the cold long enough.  Jack and Lucky
would be after him when he did not return soon
after they would expect him.
</p>

<p>
Another hour passed and he began, for the first
time, to be really frightened.  For a long time he had
been shaking with the cold, but now he did not feel
nearly so cold and a peculiar drowsiness was stealing
over him, an almost overwhelming desire to sleep.
He knew what that meant and, with all the force of
his will, he fought against it.  For awhile he kept
changing his position, but now he feared to move for
fear he would fall.  So he wedged himself in a
crotch between the trunk and a large limb in such a
way that in case he lost consciousness his body would
be held.
</p>

<p>
"God grant that they may come in time," was his
last conscious thought and then he drifted off into
nothingness.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
THE RESCUE.
</h3>

<p>
"Isn't it about time Bob was getting back?"
</p>

<p>
Jack looked at his watch as he asked the question.
</p>

<p>
"What time heem be?" Lucky asked
</p>

<p>
"Quarter past one."
</p>

<p>
"Oui, heem ought be here ver' soon."
</p>

<p>
"You don't suppose anything has happened to
him?" Jack asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Non, but wind heem change.  We goin' have snow."
</p>

<p>
"Well I wish he'd come.  Somehow I feel uneasy."
</p>

<p>
"Heem come soon."
</p>

<p>
For another half hour they waited, Jack getting
more and more uneasy.
</p>

<p>
"Hark!"
</p>

<p>
"That wolf."
</p>

<p>
"And it came from up that way."  Jack indicated
the direction which Bob had taken.
</p>

<p>
"Geet gun, we go queek."
</p>

<p>
Throwing some wood on the fire so that it would
last until they should return they quickly tied on their
snow-shoes and, taking their rifles, were off at the
fastest pace they could muster.
</p>

<p>
"You think the wolves are after him?" Jack asked
as they hurried along.
</p>

<p>
"Mebby.  But heem climb tree."
</p>

<p>
"But he'd have shot and we didn't hear any shots."
</p>

<p>
"Wind, heem wrong."
</p>

<p>
They had gone but a short distance when Jack's
quick eye caught sight of something lying nearly
concealed in the snow.  Stooping he picked up Bob's
automatic.
</p>

<p>
"It's Bob's," he gasped holding it out so that the
Indian could see it.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, heem Bob's."
</p>

<p>
"But how did it come here?"
</p>

<p>
"See, heem fall here.  Mebby gun heem fall out."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't see how it could have," Jack objected.
</p>

<p>
"Heem fall here," Lucky insisted.
</p>

<p>
"Sure he did, but I don't see how he could have
lost this gun.  But it won't do any good to stand
here talking about it."
</p>

<p>
They had heard the mournful howl of the wolves
several times since they started, and Jack grew more
and more alarmed as they advanced and he could
see that the Indian was not entirely easy in his mind
although he was doing his best to conceal it.
</p>

<p>
"We ver' near where wolf be," Lucky declared as
a long drawn out howl came from only a short
distance ahead.
</p>

<p>
"Sounds that way," Jack agreed.
</p>

<p>
"Have gun ready."
</p>

<p>
"You bet."
</p>

<p>
They hurried along for a few minutes and then
Lucky, who was a few feet ahead of Jack, suddenly
stopped and raised his rifle.  Instantly a shot rang
through the woods followed by a loud yelp of pain.
Jack hurried to his side and from there could see
the pack as they gathered about the foot of the tree.
But at that moment they were engaged in a mad fight
to see which should get the choicer portions of their
fallen comrade.
</p>

<p>
"Let heem have eet," Lucky shouted, and Jack began
pumping lead into the pack as rapidly as he
could work the ejector.
</p>

<p>
Wild yelps of pain mingled with the fierce growls
of combat filled the air.  Then, just as Jack had
emptied the magazine of his rifle, one of the wolves
saw them and with a sharp bark of anger left the
pack and sprang toward them.  Jack saw that the
wolf would be upon them before he could get his rifle
loaded and cast a quick glance at the Indian.  But he
too had exhausted his magazine and was hurriedly
loading.  The wolf was now only a few feet away
and behind him were several others and he knew
there was not an instant to lose.  Dropping his
gun he snatched his automatic from his belt and,
just as the leading animal was about to take the
final spring, he fired.  The huge wolf fell dead
at his feet a bullet in his brain, but another was upon
them almost instantly.  Jack fired again, but this
time he must have missed for the wolf did not stop
and before he could fire again he was upon him.  As
they came to the ground Jack succeeded in getting a
firm hold on the long hair at the beast's neck and,
pushing with all his strength, he was able to keep
the huge jaws away from his throat.  Over and
over they rolled in the snow, but almost at once the
boy heard the crack of Lucky's rifle and knew that
the Indian had loaded and was firing again.
</p>

<p>
After what seemed a long time and just when it
seemed that he could not hold those terrible jaws
away another instant he heard a muffled shot close at
hand and instantly he felt a convulsive shudder pass
through the wolfs body and the head fell forward
in his grasp.  Flinging it from him he sprang to his
feet.
</p>

<p>
"Heem hurt you?"
</p>

<p>
"Only a few scratches I reckon," Jack panted.
"Where are the rest of them?"
</p>

<p>
"Them run, but we kill most all."
</p>

<p>
Jack quickly glanced toward the tree, but only the
still forms lying on the snow met his gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Bob must be up that tree," he said as he looked
about for his automatic which had fallen from his
hand when the wolf hit him.  He located it almost
at once and, shoving it into his belt, he picked up his
rifle and started for the Indian who was already
nearly to the tree.
</p>

<p>
"Bob!  Bob!  Oh Bob!" he shouted as he ran.
</p>

<p>
But there was no answer and his heart almost
stopped beating as he joined Lucky beneath the
branches of the tree.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you don't&mdash;" he began, but the Indian interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"Heem must be up thar."
</p>

<p>
"Take my rifle and I'll have a look," Jack said as
he handed over the gun and swung himself up.
</p>

<p>
"He's here," he called a minute later.  "But&mdash;but
I can't seem to wake him."
</p>

<p>
The Indian was beside him almost before he had
finished speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Heem no dead," he declared after he had laid his
ear over his heart.  "We geet heem down an' back
to camp queek."
</p>

<p>
It was hard work getting the heavy body down
out of the tree, but they did it quickly knowing that
a moment more or less might well mean his life.  The
ground seem literally covered with the bodies of the
wolves, but they took no heed of them as they quickly
fastened on their snow-shoes and started back, the
Indian carrying Bob over his shoulder.  Fortunately
Jack's shoes had not been damaged in the fight and
he went ahead carrying their rifles.  Not once did
the Indian stop and he refused to allow Jack to carry
him or to help, asserting that they could make better
time that way.  Jack was amazed at the Indian's
strength and the speed which he was able to maintain
with such a heavy load.
</p>

<p>
Arrived back the Indian laid the still form on a
blanket over the bed of boughs and started rubbing
his limbs while Jack hurried to get out their medicine
case.  For fully fifteen minutes they worked before
the first sign of returning life rewarded them.  Over
and over Jack moaned that he was dead, but the
Indian insisted that it was not so and they kept on.
Then Jack noticed a slight twitching of one eyelid
and fell to work with renewed hope.
</p>

<p>
"Heem heart geet stronger," Lucky assured him.
</p>

<p>
"He's opening his eyes," Jack declared a moment
later.
</p>

<p>
A low moan followed Jack's words and Bob
opened his eyes.  A faint smile played about his
mouth, but he was too weak to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Don't try, old man," Jack cried.
</p>

<p>
"Tank de Bon Father," Lucky murmured.
</p>

<p>
They continued to work on him for some time and
as the color returned to his face Jack thanked God
over and over again for His great goodness.
</p>

<p>
"We see him feet froze," Lucky said after a little.
</p>

<p>
Quickly they unlaced the moccasins and pulled off
the heavy woolen socks.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, dem froze," Lucky declared.
</p>

<p>
"Badly?"
</p>

<p>
"Non, no bad.  Rub wid snow."
</p>

<p>
Jack did as ordered and had the great satisfaction
of seeing the color come slowly back.
</p>

<p>
"Them be heap sore for 'while, but them geet
well," Lucky declared after a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
By this time Bob was able to whisper a few words,
but the Indian cautioned him to save his strength and
soon he fell into a deep sleep.
</p>

<p>
"More heem sleep now the better," Lucky assured Jack.
</p>

<p>
"You think he'll be all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui, eef heem no have pneumonia."
</p>

<p>
"You think there's danger of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Some, but heem ver' strong an' clean.  Mebby
heem no geet eet."
</p>

<p>
They took turns watching by his side through the
long hours of the night fearful lest the dreaded fever
develop.  But Bob slept nearly all the time, waking
only to ask for water.  Once Jack was sure that he
had a temperature and awakened the Indian.  But he
thought not and a little later slight drops of moisture
on his forehead proved that he was right.
</p>

<p>
Morning came at last and with it the glad news
from Lucky that the danger was passed and that
Bob would be all right.
</p>

<p>
"But eet one ver' close call," he said.
</p>

<p>
Bob was very weak, too weak in fact to talk much
and the Indian insisted that he keep perfectly quiet.
With the light came the first flakes of snow presaging
the coming of the storm which the Indian had been
expecting.
</p>

<p>
"Injun mak' hut, you tend heem," he ordered.
</p>

<p>
He took one of the axes and went off into the
woods to return a few minutes later dragging a
number of long poles which he had trimmed clear of
branches.  With these and a lot of spruce boughs he
quickly fashioned a rude, but strong tepee large
enough to accommodate the three of them.
</p>

<p>
"You think it's going to be a bad storm?" Jack
asked after they had placed Bob inside.
</p>

<p>
"Mebby.  Most storm some bad up here."
</p>

<p>
"How long will it be before Bob is able to go on?"
</p>

<p>
"Two, mebby three day."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we must wait till he's all right."
</p>

<p>
"Oui, we wait."
</p>

<p>
In less than an hour if was evident that they were
in for another blizzard and they spent the greater
part of the day getting in a large supply of firewood.
Fortunately they found a number of dead trees only
a short distance off and by dark Lucky was certain
that they had enough to last for at least three days.
Bob had slept most of the time and seemed stronger
every time he awoke.  About four o'clock he awoke
and wanted to know if it wasn't most time to eat.  He
ate all the Indian would let him and then declared
that he was strong enough to tell them of his
adventure.
</p>

<p>
"All right, but you stop queek you geet tired,"
Lucky cautioned him.
</p>

<p>
"I know I was going to sleep, simply couldn't help
it, and I was almost equally sure that I wouldn't
wake up in this world," he told them when he had
finished.
</p>

<p>
"We must have gotten there very soon after you
went to sleep," Jack said.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, ver' queek or heem no wake," Lucky added
</p>

<p>
"How many wolves did you kill?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"We didn't stop to count them," Jack laughed.
"But we must have shot all of a dozen.  What do
you think, Lucky?"
</p>

<p>
"Mebby dozen, mebby more.  Two three got 'way."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope I never see another wolf as long as
I live," Bob declared.
</p>

<p>
"Same here," Jack added.
</p>

<p>
"We see heap more," Lucky shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so," Jack agreed.
</p>

<p>
"Injun do wrong let boy go."
</p>

<p>
"None of that stuff now," Bob said quickly.  "I'd
have been all right if I hadn't been clumsy enough to
lose my gun and that wasn't your fault."
</p>

<p>
"But Injun&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Forget it," and Lucky never mentioned the
subject again.
</p>

<p>
All that night and all the following day it snowed
and blew.  How the wind did blow outside, but
beneath the overhang of the cliff where they had
pitched the tepee it was comparatively still and
thanks to the thick circle of trees, only a small
amount of snow found its way to them.  At one side,
but beneath the overhang, Lucky had constructed a
rough shelter for the dogs and they were, as Jack
had said, "well stabled."
</p>

<p>
Long before both Jack and Bob had made warm
friends with the members of the team and although it
would be extremely dangerous for a stranger to touch
any of them, they found they could do anything with
them.  In fact, as Lucky declared, "Them dog adopt
you white boys ver' queek."
</p>

<p>
It had been the Indian's intention to start out on
a reconnoitering expedition himself the morning
following Bob's adventure, but so fierce was the storm
that he knew it would be folly to attempt it.  Bob
passed a good night and in the morning insisted that
he was all right and wanted to get up, but Lucky
would not hear of it.
</p>

<p>
"Mebby you geet up tomorrow, mebby not.  No
geet up today an' that flat, oui."
</p>

<p>
"All right, you're the doctor," Bob laughed good
naturedly, but he chafed at the restraint.
</p>

<p>
It was still snowing hard when they went to bed
that night, but Lucky declared that the wind was
working around into the west and that it would clear
before morning.  And he was right for the morning
dawned clear and cold.
</p>

<p>
"Forty below," Jack announced as he looked at
the thermometer which he had placed on the other
side of the tepee.
</p>

<p>
"That's kind of chilly around the edges," Bob
laughed as he pulled on his moccasins.
</p>

<p>
He had insisted on getting up and Lucky, after
a show of reluctance, had given in.
</p>

<p>
"How much snow has fallen?" Jack asked the
Indian who just then entered the tepee.
</p>

<p>
"Heap lot.  Eet drift ver' much, but must be four
feet on level.  Breakfast heem ready."
</p>

<p>
"And so are we and hungry too," Bob told him.
</p>

<p>
"You feel all right, oui?"
</p>

<p>
"Fine's a fiddle."
</p>

<p>
"No weak?"
</p>

<p>
"No weak."
</p>

<p>
"Bon."
</p>

<p>
"Bon is right," Bob smiled.
</p>

<p>
"And now what's the program?" Jack asked as
soon as the meal was finished.
</p>

<p>
"We all go find cabin?"  Lucky looked at Jack and
then at Bob.
</p>

<p>
"Fine."  Both the boys spoke the word at the
same time.
</p>

<p>
They left in about a half hour just as the sun was
casting its first rays into the defile.  They found the
traveling extremely hard as the snow was light and
their snow-shoes sank several inches at every step.
But they took it easy, Lucky in the lead, for he was
afraid, that, in spite of Bob's declaration, the boy
had not as yet fully recovered his strength.  It took
them the better part of an hour to reach the scene of
Bob's adventure and he was unable to prevent a shudder
as he caught sight of the tree in the branches of
which he had so nearly perished.  The bodies of the
wolves were, of course, buried deep beneath the snow
and there was nothing except remembrance to recall
the terrible experience.
</p>

<p>
"You tired?" Lucky asked Bob as they stopped
beneath the tree.
</p>

<p>
"Little bit," Bob replied reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
"We rest leetle beet, oui?"
</p>

<p>
"Guess we better, but I'm all right."
</p>

<p>
"You feel bon, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"I sure do," Bob assured.  "Only a bit puffed."
</p>

<p>
"How far do you suppose it is to the cabin?" Jack
asked.
</p>

<p>
"No can say.  Eet may be mile mebby two, mebby
three.  Fellers up here no sure of distance."
</p>

<p>
"In which respect they haven't a thing on a lot
people back home," Jack laughed.  "Remember that
farmer, Bob, up near Jackman, who told us it was
only a little over a mile to town when it was exactly
four and a half?"
</p>

<p>
"And he'd lived there all his life," Bob laughed.
</p>

<p>
After a short rest they started off again, Bob taking
the lead with strict orders from Lucky to go slow
and not get tired.  Not a breath of wind stirred the
branches of the trees and not a sound save the crunch
of their snow-shoes on the dry snow.  All nature
seemed at rest and, although the sun was low in the
sky, its rays had raised the temperature noticeably
since they left the camp.
</p>

<p>
"My, but it's getting real hot," Jack laughed as he
took off his cap and went through the motions of
fanning himself.  "I don't believe it's much more
than thirty below."
</p>

<p>
They had stopped again for a breathing spell and
Bob, in spite of his efforts to conceal it, was
breathing heavily.
</p>

<p>
"You no so strong you tink, eh?" Lucky asked
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm all right only I seem to get out of wind
rather easily," Bob asserted.
</p>

<p>
"We tak' heem more easy."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  You're the boss."
</p>

<p>
"We've made about two miles don't you think?"
Jack asked, turning to Lucky.
</p>

<p>
"'Bout."
</p>

<p>
"Then I suppose we're apt to run into that cabin
most any time now."
</p>

<p>
"Mebby."
</p>

<p>
But another long mile lay before them before they
came to the end of their search.  Bob was again in
the lead and he suddenly stopped and held up one
hand as a signal for the others to come to a halt.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" Jack asked as he came back to
where they were standing.
</p>

<p>
"The cabin is about fifty feet from where I was,"
he announced in a low tone.
</p>

<p>
"You see heem?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"You see smoke come from heem chimney?"
</p>

<p>
"No, there was none."
</p>

<p>
"White boys stay here while Injun go see."
</p>

<p>
Without waiting for them to object the Indian
started off and was almost at once lost to sight amid
the thick trees.
</p>

<p>
"Was it a big cabin?" Jack asked
</p>

<p>
"Not so big."
</p>

<p>
"If there was no smoke it looks as though there
was no one there, I should say."
</p>

<p>
"It sure looks that way, but I reckon we'll know
before long."
</p>

<p>
In less than ten minutes they heard Lucky shout
for them to come.
</p>

<p>
"That settles that part of it," Bob declared as they
started.
</p>

<p>
"Sure does," Jack agreed.
</p>

<p>
In another moment they were through the fringe
of trees and in plain sight of the little cabin which
stood beneath the branches of one of the largest
spruces they had ever seen.  Lucky was standing a
few feet from the door and they could see that the
snow was banked nearly half way to its top.
</p>

<p>
"And there are no tracks except his," Jack declared
as they advanced.
</p>

<p>
"No one home?" Bob asked trying to conceal his
disappointment.
</p>

<p>
"Non, no one home," Lucky echoed.
</p>

<p>
The three looked at each other for a full minute
before anyone spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"We must get in," Bob finally said.
</p>

<p>
"It's going to be some job to get that door open
without a shovel," Jack declared.
</p>

<p>
"How about a window?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui, we geet in window."
</p>

<p>
There were but two windows, one on each side, and
they consisted of a single pane of glass about
fourteen inches square.
</p>

<p>
"Going to be a pretty tight squeeze even if we
can get it open," Bob said as they halted after
making a circuit of the cabin.
</p>

<p>
"But I reckon we can make it," Jack declared as
he stepped close to the window and began to examine
it.  "It's nailed fast," he announced a moment later.
</p>

<p>
"Think we can drive it open?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Could if we had a hammer or an axe."
</p>

<p>
"Which we haven't, but there's a pile of wood
out back.  You wait a minute till I see what I can
find."
</p>

<p>
He was back shortly with two sticks of wood one
about a foot long and an inch or more thick while the
other was nearly four feet long and about three
times as thick.
</p>

<p>
"Here we are," he said as he handed the small
piece to Jack.  "Now, you hold that against one
corner and I'll see what I can do."
</p>

<p>
Jack did as directed and Bob began to hammer
the end of the stick with his club, gently at first and
then harder as the frame showed no sign of yielding.
</p>

<p>
"Guess they must have used spikes," he said as
he paused to examine the frame after he had struck
thirty or more blows.
</p>

<p>
"Mebby better try other one," the Indian suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Not a bad idea," Bob agreed.  "Come on, Jack,
perhaps that one isn't nailed so hard."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to get in there if I have to break the
glass," Jack declared as he followed the others
around to the other side.
</p>

<p>
"I hope it won't be necessary."
</p>

<p>
"She's giving a bit," Jack shouted after Bob had
been hammering away for about five minutes.
</p>

<p>
"Good."
</p>

<p>
"Bon."
</p>

<p>
"That's enough.  I think I can push it out the rest
of the way," Jack told them after a few more blows
had made a large crack between the window frame
and the sill.
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Go to it," Bob panted.
</p>

<p>
Jack pushed with all his strength and finally had
the satisfaction of forcing the window completely
out.
</p>

<p>
"Now for the squeeze," he said as he laid the window
down on the snow.
</p>

<p>
"Better take a good look around inside there first,"
Bob cautioned.
</p>

<p>
"Don't see anything to be afraid of," he
announced a moment later.  "So here goes."
</p>

<p>
Jack and Lucky had little difficulty in getting in,
but Bob was thicker and with him it was indeed a
tight squeeze and they had to help him.  But finally
they were all in and ready to inspect the cabin.
</p>

<p>
To be sure the small windows admitted but little
light, but they were able to see well enough after the
first few minutes.  The cabin consisted of but a single
room and was meagerly furnished.  An old rusty
cook stove in the center, a rough table and three old
straight backed chairs together with a couple of
rude bunks filled with spruce boughs about completed
the inventory, with the exception of a rough
closet at one end which contained a few pots and
pans and a few cracked dishes and three or four
knives, forks and spoons.  The floor was of dirt.
</p>

<p>
"Gee, it doesn't look as though anyone had lived
here for a good while," Jack said after they had
made the complete circuit of the big room.
</p>

<p>
"It sure doesn't look promising," Bob agreed.
</p>

<p>
"Heem look ver'&mdash;what you call heem&mdash;punk,"
Lucky added.
</p>

<p>
"Punk is right and then some," Jack told him.
</p>

<p>
"But the place looks mighty clean," Bob declared.
</p>

<p>
"But that doesn't mean anything, does it?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know that it does," Bob acknowledged.
</p>

<p>
"How long since anyone has been here," Jade
asked, turning to the Indian.
</p>

<p>
"No can tell."
</p>

<p>
"But you can guess."
</p>

<p>
"Mebby week, mebby year."  Lucky shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"And that's not very definite,"
</p>

<p>
"Not ver'," Lucky confessed.
</p>

<p>
All this time the Indian had been moving about
examining each object with the utmost minuteness
in an effort, he explained a few minutes later, to get
a clue as to what manner of men had last occupied
the cabin and how long ago they had been there.  But
he was forced to acknowledge that it was too much
for him and that he was beat.
</p>

<p>
"Injun hate geev up," he said shaking his head
sadly.  "But no can tell."
</p>

<p>
"But I've found something."
</p>

<p>
Bob was at the other end of the room from the
others as he spoke and they hastened to where he
was closely examining one of the logs which was
about on a level with his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" Jack asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
Bob made no reply, but pointed with his finger.
</p>

<p>
"S. L."
</p>

<p>
Jack spelled out the letters slowly and then looked
at his brother.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"S. L. stand for Silas Lakewood, don't they?"
Bob asked a bit impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"They could, of course, but don't forget that they
could also stand for a good many other names as
well.  It doesn't look to me as though those letters
were cut there very recently.  What do you say,
Lucky?"
</p>

<p>
The Indian looked at the letters for a long time
before he made any reply, but he finally turned to
Jack and said:
</p>

<p>
"Heap hard tell, but Injun tink them not ver' old,
mebby three, mebby four week."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you think so?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Color wood tell Injun."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think it's a pretty safe bet that he's been
here anyhow," Bob declared.
</p>

<p>
"But we knew that before," Jack said.  "Or at
least we have that man's word for it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes and these letters make it pretty near certain,
don't you think, Lucky?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui, heem been here."
</p>

<p>
"Granted for the sake of the argument, and now
what's the next step?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll never tell you," Bob said soberly.
</p>

<p>
"It kind of looks to me as though we're at the end
of our rope so to speak," Jack declared.
</p>

<p>
"What's your opinion, Lucky?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Eet not bon&mdash;what you call heem&mdash;situation,"
the Indian began after a moment of deep thought.
"We no can track heem in fresh snow, Lightnin'
heem bon tracker, but no bon here."
</p>

<p>
"But we can't give up yet," Bob told him.
</p>

<p>
"We no geeve heem up."
</p>

<p>
"Then what?"
</p>

<p>
"Mebby we wait two, three day, mebby dey come
back, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"And mebby they won't," Jack added.  "But I
guess that's as good a plan as any.  What do you
say, Bob?"
</p>

<p>
"I reckon it is.  To try to follow them under the
circumstances would be mere guess work unless we
can find some clue on the outside."
</p>

<p>
"That's a mighty good idea.  I never thought of
that," Jack said.  "Let's get at it."
</p>

<p>
"Better wait till 'nother day," Lucky advised.
"Eet geet dark time we geet back now an' we got
nothin' eat."
</p>

<p>
So, after a little discussion it was decided that
they would go back to the camp and come again
early in the morning and hunt all day if necessary
for a clue.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
THE ESKIMO.
</h3>

<p>
"Now I reckon we'll need all the woodcraft we
ever learned."
</p>

<p>
The sun was not yet up although it was after ten
o'clock and they were once more standing in front
of the cabin.  The night before they had seriously
considered the plan of moving all their stuff into the
cabin and making it their headquarters, but Lucky
had not been in favor of it, pointing out that they
would have to build a fire in the stove and that the
smoke would betray their presence in case the man
should return.  So the final vote had been against it.
</p>

<p>
It was Bob who made the above statement and
both Jack and the Indian readily agreed with him.
</p>

<p>
"Which way do you think they most likely went?"
Jack asked looking first at Bob and then at Lucky.
</p>

<p>
"North, I should say," Bob replied and Lucky
nodded agreement.  "You see, if they had gone
south we would probably have run into them or at
least heard from them from someone who did," he
explained.
</p>

<p>
"Then I reckon we'd better hunt up that way
first," Jack proposed.
</p>

<p>
Both the boys, having spent a good part of their
lives in the great woods of Northern Maine, were
very expert in reading the signs of the forest and, as
Jack had more than once declared, the Indian forgot
more about such things every night than they ever
knew.  But in spite of all this several hours of hard
searching told them next to nothing.  To be sure
they found plenty of signs which told them that
someone had been there not many weeks previous
but, as Jack put it, there were altogether too many
of them, for they found them not only to the north,
but on all other sides as well, and there was absolutely
nothing to indicate the direction they had taken when
they quit the cabin for the last time.
</p>

<p>
"Looks like a case of heads you win and tails I
lose," Jack said a bit discouragingly as they finally
stopped to swallow the lunch they had brought with
them.
</p>

<p>
"Don't quite see the connection," Bob told him.
</p>

<p>
"Gray matter working a bit sluggishly today?"
</p>

<p>
"Maybe."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if we stay here we're not likely to find them
and if we don't we're not."
</p>

<p>
"Don't what?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't stay here."
</p>

<p>
"Oh.  Well, your comparison is very poor.  In
fact it is not applicable to the case in hand at all."
</p>

<p>
"Which may or may not be a matter of opinion,"
Jack grinned good naturedly.
</p>

<p>
"Leesten."
</p>

<p>
The Indian suddenly held up his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Someone's coming," Bob declared a moment later.
</p>

<p>
"Queek, we geet out sight."
</p>

<p>
They were only a short distance from the cabin
and it was but a moment's work to gather up the remains
of their lunch and slip around to the other side
of it.
</p>

<p>
"But they'll see our tracks," Jack said.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, but we can't help that," Bob told him.
</p>

<p>
It was but a few moments before they heard a loud
voice calling on a team of dogs to stop and Lucky
whispered:
</p>

<p>
"Eet Eskimo."
</p>

<p>
"Then we might as well show ourselves," Jack
suggested.
</p>

<p>
They at once stepped out from behind the cabin,
the Indian in the lead, and saw that he had been
right in his estimate of the nationality of the stranger.
He was a short fat man completely swathed in furs
and was accompanied by a team of four dogs with
an nearly empty sled.  He was busily engaged in
examining their tracks and they were within a few
feet of him before he was aware of their presence.
</p>

<p>
"How," Lucky said pleasantly as the man looked up.
</p>

<p>
"Ugh."
</p>

<p>
It was a grunt, but whether meant to be pleasant
or hostile the boys were unable to tell.
</p>

<p>
"Where you come?"
</p>

<p>
The Eskimo shook his head evidently not understanding
the question.
</p>

<p>
The Indian repeated the question this time in
French, but he again shook his head at the same
time saying something in a language entirely new to
the boys.  But Lucky understood him for he
immediately answered in the same language, and, for
several minutes they carried on a spirited conversation
helped along by many eloquent gestures on the
part of the stranger.
</p>

<p>
"Heem say heem live three hundred mile nor' of
here," Lucky told them when the man stopped for a
moment.
</p>

<p>
"Ask him if he's seen the men we're after," Bob
suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Injun asked an' heem say oui, heem seen 'em."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"'Bout hundred mile nor'."
</p>

<p>
"How long ago?" Bob asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Three day.  Heem say dey got leetle camp on
Colville River."
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever been there?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"Noo, Injun no go nor' more dan leetle way more."
</p>

<p>
"Ask him if he'll be our guest for the night," Bob
directed.
</p>

<p>
"Heem say oui," Lucky announced as soon as he
had given the invitation and received his answer.
</p>

<p>
"Then I reckon we might as well be getting back
to camp."
</p>

<p>
"Oui, we go."
</p>

<p>
They arrived back at camp just as it was getting
dark and Lucky directed the stranger to make
himself at home.  The Eskimo took in the location of
the camp at a glance and then drove his dogs to a
thicket a few yards away where he quickly located
them for the night.
</p>

<p>
"Heem no dare put heem dog near ours, fear dem
fight," Lucky explained.
</p>

<p>
"He seems to be a sort of a grouch," Jack declared
a little later as he noted how the stranger persisted
in keeping much to himself.
</p>

<p>
"Probably he's bashful," Bob smiled.
</p>

<p>
But his shyness vanished quickly as soon as supper
was ready and he ate with great relish the food
which Lucky heaped on his plate.
</p>

<p>
"Too bad we haven't any candles to offer him,"
Jack laughed.
</p>

<p>
"He seems to be doing very well as it is," Bob
laughed back.
</p>

<p>
"I'd hate to have him for a steady boarder."
</p>

<p>
When it came time to turn in, Lucky, at Bob's
suggestion, offered the Eskimo a place in the tepee,
but he declined on the ground that it would be too
warm.
</p>

<p>
"Heem say heem sleep out door, geet plenty air."
</p>

<p>
At Bob's suggestion the Indian had questioned the
man further regarding the two men they were hunting,
but it seemed that he knew no more than he had
told them at first.  He had seen them as he came by,
but had stopped only to pass the time of day.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after six o'clock the following morning,
Bob awoke with a strange sense of impending disaster.
Had he heard someone prowling about in the
night or had he only dreamed if?  Careful not to
disturb the others, who were still sleeping, he wiggled
out of his bag and crept noiselessly outside.  For a
moment he stood gazing into the North where
streamer after streamer sent an almost dazzling light
far up into the heavens.
</p>

<p>
"I never saw such a display of the Northern
Lights," he murmured as he gazed at the scene at
most spellbound.
</p>

<p>
The fire was burning low only a few embers showing
a dim light, but it was not dark and he could see
plainly for some distance.  There was no sign of
their guest and he concluded that he must have slept
over near his dogs.  Moving quietly he made his way
toward the thicket stopping every few feet to listen.
He did not want the man to suspect that he was
spying on him, but some inner sense told him that all
was not well.  And a moment later his suspicions
were strengthened when he found that both man and
team were gone.
</p>

<p>
"It's strange," he thought as he looked at the place
where they had huddled together.
</p>

<p>
Then he turned and ran quickly over behind the
tepee where their stores were packed on the sled.
And now his suspicions were confirmed.  He had
heard someone prowling behind the tepee during the
night and he was disgusted with himself that he had
not awakened sufficiently to make an investigation.
Their stores had been rifled and, it seemed to him,
the greater part of them were gone.
</p>

<p>
"Jack!  Lucky!" he yelled.
</p>

<p>
There was no answer and he yelled again this time
louder, and was rewarded by a "huh" from Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Get out here and make it snappy."
</p>

<p>
"Where's the fire?" Jack asked sleepily a moment
later as he poked his head out of the tepee.
</p>

<p>
"He's gone."
</p>

<p>
"Who's gone?"
</p>

<p>
"That Eskimo."
</p>

<p>
"Well, why make such a fuss over a little thing
like that?"  Jack was out of the tepee with the Indian
close behind him.
</p>

<p>
"Take a look here and you'll know," Bob snapped.
</p>

<p>
"The&mdash;the,"
</p>

<p>
"All that and some more," Bob interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"To think that he'd steal our food," Jack gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Heem one beeg thief," Lucky added.
</p>

<p>
"But we've got to have those things back.  He's
taken nearly everything we had," Bob declared after
he had investigated a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Injun go geet heem."
</p>

<p>
"And we'll go with you," Jack added.
</p>

<p>
"Non," Lucky shook his head.  "Injun go faster
heemself."
</p>

<p>
"You'll take the dogs?" Bob asked without arguing
the point for he knew Lucky was right.  They
were no match for him when it came to speed.
</p>

<p>
"Oui.  Tak' dog, bring back stuff."  The Indian
was already hurrying toward the dog shed and in
less than five minutes he was ready to start.
</p>

<p>
"You stay here till I come bac'," he ordered as he
gave the order to mush.
</p>

<p>
"How long do you expect to be gone?" Bob
shouted after him.
</p>

<p>
"No can tell.  Be bac' as queek as can."
</p>

<p>
"And I hope it will be soon," Bob said turning to
Jack.  "I'll be mighty uneasy until he returns."
</p>

<p>
"Same here.  There was something about that guy
that I didn't like a little bit.  He had a bad eye."
</p>

<p>
"Also a bad disposition."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope Lucky gets him and gets the stuff
back.  It'll be very inconvenient for us to say the
least if he doesn't."
</p>

<p>
"He'll do it if anyone could, and I don't imagine
it will take him very long to catch up with him as
our dogs are well rested and his must be tired."
</p>

<p>
"Not so very tired either.  Remember he's been
traveling light."
</p>

<p>
"That's true too.  I wonder how long he's been
gone."
</p>

<p>
"That's hard to say.  And, by the way, it's kind
of strange that none of us heard him."
</p>

<p>
"I did," Bob told him.
</p>

<p>
"You did?  Well, why in the name of common
sense, didn't you stop him or do something?" Jack
demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, I didn't get awake enough to really
know that I had heard anything.  I remember wondering
if I had really heard it or had just dreamed
it.  It's too bad, of course, but there's no use crying
over spilled milk."
</p>

<p>
"Don't think I was blaming you, old man," Jack
hastened to assure him.  "It wasn't your fault.  But
I'm hungry.  Let's get something to eat if he's left
us anything at all."
</p>

<p>
"Righto.  You build up the fire and I'll see what
I can find."
</p>

<p>
Jack had the fire going in good shape by the time
Bob was back with a can of condensed milk and a
small package.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to make out with flapjacks," he announced.
</p>

<p>
"Is that all you could find?" Jack asked disappointedly.
</p>

<p>
"This is all he left us in the eating line.  I don't
know how he came to overlook these."
</p>

<p>
"He took all the coffee?"
</p>

<p>
"Every bit of it."
</p>

<p>
"He ought to be hanged."
</p>

<p>
"And then some."
</p>

<p>
"If he was in need of food and had taken a little I
wouldn't have blamed him so much, but to strip us
clean up here in this wilderness&mdash;well, it's little short
of murder."
</p>

<p>
"You said it.  Believe me I would like to be with
Lucky when he gets him.  I'm afraid he won't do
the case justice."
</p>

<p>
"Leave it to him.  I think he'll be equal to the
occasion."
</p>

<p>
The flapjacks proved pretty dry eating without
coffee to wash them down, but they managed to make
out with melted snow.
</p>

<p>
"What'll we do to pass the time?" Jack asked as
soon as they were finished.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go hunting," Bob suggested.  "We ought
to be able to get a deer; goodness knows we've seen
plenty of tracks and we need the food."
</p>

<p>
"Goodness knows that too," Jack laughed as he
crept into the tepee for the rifles and snow-shoes.
</p>

<p>
They struck out toward the north and had not
been gone more than a quarter of an hour when they
came upon the tracks of a deer.  It was yet dark and
not for another two hours would the sun show itself,
but the moon, which was nearly full, gave
sufficient light to see for a long distance.
</p>

<p>
"They look pretty fresh," Bob announced after
he had carefully examined the tracks.
</p>

<p>
"Then I reckon we'd better follow them."
</p>

<p>
The tracks crossed their trail at right angles and
led up the side of the mountain to their right.  At
this point, however, the assent was not steep and,
although they plunged at once into thick woods, they
found the going easier than they had expected.
</p>

<p>
"He's sinking in pretty deep," Jack said as they
hurried along.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we ought to catch up with him before long
unless the tracks are older than I think."
</p>

<p>
They had been climbing for the better part of an
hour when the tracks turned and lead parallel with
the side of the mountain.  At first they welcomed
the change in direction, thinking that it would be
easier but, before they had gone a hundred yards
farther, they found themselves on a part of the
mountain where it was much steeper and, owing to
the slant, it was extremely difficult to keep their
balance.  But they went on as rapidly as possible,
now and then falling headlong in the snow as a shoe
slipped and threw them off their balance.  But they
each time picked themselves up with a laugh and
hurried on confident that they must soon sight their
quarry.
</p>

<p>
"Look over there," Bob said as he paused and
pointed toward the east.
</p>

<p>
"It's beautiful," Jack declared as he watched the
edge of the sun, looking like a huge ball of fire,
creeping over the top of the opposite mountain.
"But there's something even more beautiful just at
present," he whispered a moment later as he clutched
Bob's arm and pointed to a spot about a hundred
feet in front.
</p>

<p>
There, on a slight rise in the ground, stood a
magnificent buck facing them.  The animal stood up to
its knees in the snow and did not seem at all afraid.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't he a beauty?" Bob whispered.
</p>

<p>
"It's a shame to shoot him," Jack replied.  "But
we've got to have the meat so let's get it over with."
</p>

<p>
Raising their rifles they took careful aim and both
fired at the same time.  The deer fell in its tracks
and never moved.
</p>

<p>
"He had an easy death at any rate," Bob said as
they went toward it.
</p>

<p>
"He's too big to carry in whole so we'll have to cut
him up here."
</p>

<p>
Both boys knew how to dress a deer as they had
many times hunted in the Maine woods and, in the
course of an hour, they had selected the choicest
pieces and hung the rest well up in the branches of
a tree where it would be out of the reach of the
wolves.
</p>

<p>
"So far so good," Jack said as they were fixing
the meat so that they could fasten it to their backs.
"Now if we get back all right and find that Lucky
has returned without stuff&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hold on there," Bob interrupted.  "Don't tempt
providence too far with your ifs."
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's nothing like being optimistic as
I've heard you say many a time."
</p>

<p>
"Up to a certain point."
</p>

<p>
"And I reckon you think I'd reached that point,"
Jack laughed.
</p>

<p>
When they were ready to start each boy had nearly
fifty pounds of meat strapped to his back and the
load made traveling doubly hard as they soon found.
But their success had made them again light hearted
and they did not mind the hard work.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon Lucky'll be some surprised when he sees
us come in with all this meat," Jack said when they
were about half way back to where the trail had
turned.
</p>

<p>
"If he's back," Bob reminded him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think he'll be back by the time we get
there?"
</p>

<p>
"I doubt it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, here's hoping."
</p>

<p>
It was about one o'clock when they reached the
place where the trail had turned and both agreed that
they had better take a rest before starting down
the mountain.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how you feel about it, but I'm all
in," Jack panted as he unslung his pack.
</p>

<p>
"Same here," Bob agreed.  "That was about as
hard a tramp as I ever took."
</p>

<p>
They rested for a half hour and then started off
again Jack taking the lead.  They had taken but a
few steps when Bob spoke to him and in turning his
head to reply Jack carelessly tripped himself and
pitched headlong into the snow.  It was by no means
the first time it had happened and Bob broke into a
roar of laughter.  But the mirth died on his lips as
he heard Jack utter a loud groan.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" he cried as he hurried forward.
</p>

<p>
"Afraid I've sprained or broken my ankle," he
groaned.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe it's not so bad as you think," Bob
encouraged as he put his hands beneath his shoulders
and helped him to get to his feet.
</p>

<p>
But Jack sank down again with a low moan of pain.
</p>

<p>
"I can't do it," he groaned.
</p>

<p>
"Let me have a look at it."
</p>

<p>
Bob unfastened the thongs which held the foot to
the snow-shoe and carefully unlaced the moccasin.
</p>

<p>
"Am I hurting?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Some, but it doesn't matter."
</p>

<p>
By the time he had drawn off the heavy sock the
ankle had swollen somewhat and, as carefully as
possible, he examined it.  First aid to the injured
had been taught them at the military college and both
boys knew not a little about such injuries.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty sore, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Some."
</p>

<p>
"I'm pretty sure it's not broken, but it looks like
a pretty bad sprain and that's almost as bad," he
announced as he started to draw on the sock.
</p>

<p>
"What'll we do?"
</p>

<p>
"Get back as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but I can't walk."
</p>

<p>
"Of.  course you can't, but I reckon I can carry
you."
</p>

<p>
"Not down this mountain you can't."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to anyhow."
</p>

<p>
Seeing that his brother was determined Jack made
no further objection and, as soon as Bob had cached
the two packs of meat in the branches of a nearby
tree, he set about getting ready for the start.
</p>

<p>
"You'll never make it."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you believe it."
</p>

<p>
It was hard work getting the injured boy onto his
back without hurting him, but finally it was accomplished
and, as Jack declared, without hurting a bit.
</p>

<p>
"Now you take it easy," he cautioned as Bob
took the first step.
</p>

<p>
Even he had not fully realized how hard it would
be.  The extra weight caused his snow-shoes to sink
much deeper in the snow and going down hill made
each shoe push itself forward into the snow thus
rendering it very difficult to lift it up for the next
step.  But he knew that it had to be done.  With
the temperature nearly thirty degrees below zero and
getting lower all the time as he thought, he knew it
would be death to leave him for any length of time.
</p>

<p>
"Rest awhile," Jack begged after they had covered
a few rods.
</p>

<p>
"I'm all right for a bit yet."
</p>

<p>
"Better do as I say."
</p>

<p>
"In a minute."
</p>

<p>
It was not much over the stated time when he was
obliged to put him down.
</p>

<p>
"Jack, heem heap heavy, as Lucky would say," he
panted as he carefully lowered him to the trunk of
a fallen tree.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you'd find you'd bit off a bit more'n
you could chew."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it and that's three bits in two
sentences.  I didn't say I could carry you all the way
in one jump."
</p>

<p>
"Well, take as many as you like."
</p>

<p>
"Does the foot hurt?"
</p>

<p>
"Not much: kind of a dull ache, but I'm afraid
it's swelling some."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt of it and it'll continue to swell for
some time yet."
</p>

<p>
He made the foot of the mountain in the next spell
but was obliged to rest again before going farther.
</p>

<p>
"It'll be a lot easier now we're on level ground,"
he panted.
</p>

<p>
"If only I was one of those skinny fellows now it
wouldn't be so hard on you."
</p>

<p>
"You're all right just as you are, that is all but
your ankle."
</p>

<p>
Bob was resolved to make camp without stopping
again, knowing that the sooner he got Jack where
he could treat the injured ankle with hot water the
better it would be.  So he took as short a rest as he
dared and, despite Jack's protests, he was soon on
the go again.  As he had said it was easier now, but
it seemed as though every muscle in his body was
at the breaking point when finally he carefully
lowered him onto the boughs in the tepee.
</p>

<p>
"Now I'll get a fire going and heat some water as
soon as I can," he assured him.  "Is it hurting
much?"
</p>

<p>
"Not bad."
</p>

<p>
"I'll bet it is just the same," Bob muttered under
his breath as he hurried out of the tepee.
</p>

<p>
He had a fire going in a few minutes, but it took
considerable time before the water was boiling hot.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," he said cheerfully as he re-entered the
tepee with a kettle of the steaming water.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't take you long."
</p>

<p>
"It seemed a long time to me.  I thought the
water would never come to a boil," Bob told him as
he began to unlace the moccasin.  "Yell if I hurt
you."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be afraid.  I'll yell all right."
</p>

<p>
When he had removed the sock he found that the
ankle had swelled to an alarming extent and he could
not repress a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Rather bad isn't it?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"It's not so good and that's a fact."
</p>

<p>
"I thought it was swelling pretty fast."
</p>

<p>
Wringing out a towel in the water he bound it as
tightly as Jack could stand about the ankle.
</p>

<p>
"You got it hot all right," Jack grinned.
</p>

<p>
"The hotter the better just so it doesn't burn."
</p>

<p>
"Guess I can stand it."
</p>

<p>
For an hour he continued the treatment changing
the towel as soon as it became cool and putting
on a hot one and, at the end of that time, had the
great satisfaction of knowing that the swelling had
subsided considerably.
</p>

<p>
"There, I reckon we'll have to let nature take its
course," he said as he finished.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it about time Lucky's getting back?" Jack
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott, I haven't given him a thought since
we got back.  Let's see, it's just one o'clock and I
hardly expect him before dark.  Now, I'll get us a
bite of flapjacks and then I must go back and bring
in that meat."
</p>

<p>
"Won't it be safe till morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Maybe, but a venison steak will go pretty good
for supper tonight, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
"I reckon, but you're too tired to go way back
there."
</p>

<p>
"Tired your grandmother.  I'll be back almost
before you know I'm gone.  It isn't far."
</p>

<p>
By a quarter of two they had eaten of the scanty
fare and Bob was ready to start.
</p>

<p>
"I'll leave your rifle right here by your side," he
said.  "Now don't you move that foot while I'm
gone and I'll be back just as soon as I can make it."
</p>

<p>
"Don't kill yourself.  I'll be all right."
</p>

<p>
"Good bye, then."  Bob bent and kissed his
brother's cheek.
</p>

<p>
"You're the best in the world," Jack told him as he
shook his hand.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
LUCKY BRINGS BACK THE "BACON."
</h3>

<p>
Although Bob had tried hard to conceal his fears
he had been much worried since Lucky had left them.
To be sure he had unbounded confidence in the
Indian, but he also realized that he was not infallible
and he had little doubt regarding the character of
the Eskimo who had stolen their food.  Any man
who would do a thing of that sort would not be likely
to hesitate at even murder were his safety
threatened.  Should anything happen to prevent his
return they would be in a pretty desperate situation
especially now that Jack was helpless.
</p>

<p>
These thoughts filled his mind as he started off,
but he whistled a merry tune until he knew he was
out of hearing.
</p>

<p>
"I do hope he'll be back when I return," he said
half aloud.
</p>

<p>
He found the packs of meat as he had left them
and decided to leave one where it was as he was, in
spite of his assurance in Jack's presence, pretty tired
and fifty pounds was about all he cared to lug back
under the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
"The rest'll be safe enough," he thought as he
slung the pack to his back.
</p>

<p>
Although it was not yet three o'clock when he
stumbled into camp, tired through and through,
darkness had fallen.  He had started whistling as
soon as he knew that he was in hearing distance and
Jack's voice, as he shouted a welcome, assured him
that all was well so far as he was concerned.
</p>

<p>
"Lucky's not back yet," he said as he swung the
pack to the ground and entered the tepee.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, he's likely to come any minute now,"
he said trying to speak cheerfully.  "How's the
foot?"
</p>

<p>
"The patient is doing as well as could be expected."
</p>

<p>
"Hurt much?"
</p>

<p>
"Not much.  But you must be about played out."
</p>

<p>
"Not so you'd notice it.  Think you can masticate
a good juicy steak?"
</p>

<p>
"Lead me to it, or rather lead it to me."
</p>

<p>
There was still a good bed of coals and in a very
few minutes Bob had a huge steak sizzling in the
frying pan.
</p>

<p>
"Thank goodness he didn't take both bags of salt,"
he said to himself as he found a small sack of the
precious material which the thief had overlooked.
"Now, if he'd only left us a few spuds it wouldn't
be so bad, but perhaps Lucky'll be back with them by
the time the steak's ready."
</p>

<p>
But he was not and they had to eat it straight, as
Jack put it.  However hunger is an excellent sauce
and the thick juicy steak, cooked to a turn, went
down with no urging.
</p>

<p>
"Best thing I ever tasted," Jack declared after
he had eaten all he could manage.
</p>

<p>
"Not half bad, but I do wish Lucky'd come."
</p>

<p>
"If wishes were horses, you know," Jack quoted.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know.  But he ought to be getting along."
</p>

<p>
Although Jack objected strenuously Bob insisted
on giving the ankle another hot water treatment and
it was close to six o'clock when he had finished, and
the Indian had not returned.
</p>

<p>
"Something's gone wrong with Lucky," Jack declared.
</p>

<p>
"I hardly think so.  You see, there's no telling
how far he had to chase him and you know Lucky."
</p>

<p>
"And we don't know that Eskimo.  There's the rub."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Honest Injun, now, aren't you worried?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure I am, but I honestly think he'll come back
all right."
</p>

<p>
"How long do you think this old ankle will lay
me up?"
</p>

<p>
"A week maybe."
</p>

<p>
"A week, your grandmother's eye.  Bet you I
walk on it tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe, but I doubt it."
</p>

<p>
During the past half hour Bob had been conscious
that the wind was rising steadily and the fact caused
him no little uneasiness.  If they should have
another blizzard before the Indian returned it would
make their lot doubly hard.  As he went outside to
replenish the fire he cast an anxious eye upward and
his fears were increased when he was unable to see
any stars.
</p>

<p>
"I believe it's going to snow again," he muttered
as he threw a big log on the fire.
</p>

<p>
As he again looked up a flake of snow struck his
face and he turned back and entered the tepee with
a sinking heart.
</p>

<p>
"How's the weather?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not so good."
</p>

<p>
"Snowing?"
</p>

<p>
"Starting a bit."
</p>

<p>
"I thought that wind sounded like it."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it won't amount to anything."
</p>

<p>
"Storms usually don't up here," Jack said
sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
"But this one may be an exception."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe.  But, honest Injun, Bob, we're in rather
a bad fix, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Bad, but not desperate.  We've got food enough,
thanks to that buck, to last a good while so we won't
starve and, thank goodness, we had sense enough to
keep our ammunition in the tepee so he didn't get
away with that.  I don't see that we're in any great
danger."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you'd better put that light out.  All the oil
we have left is in those two lanterns."
</p>

<p>
Bob blew out the light and for a long time they
sat in the darkness and talked.  The temperature had
risen during the past few hours and the heat reflected
from the fire, which Bob kept going, made it very
comfortable in the snug tepee.  Each did his best to
appear cheerful but each knew that the other was
far more anxious that he let on.  While they knew
that they were in no great danger the thought that
their friend might be lying dead or wounded
somewhere out in the storm made the situation almost
unbearable.  Several times Bob had been out to
replenish the fire and each time he reported that it
was snowing.  To be sure the storm had not as yet
reached the height of a blizzard, but each time he
went out he realized that the wind was stronger and
the snow was coming down faster.
</p>

<p>
"It's ten o'clock," he announced.  "Shall we hit
the hay?"
</p>

<p>
"Might's well I reckon.  He won't be back tonight."
</p>

<p>
Bob lit the lantern and helped Jack get into his
sleeping bag.  Then he went out and fixed the fire
so that it would last for several hours.
</p>

<p>
"It's going to be a blizzard all right," he muttered
as he crept back into the tepee and into his sleeping
bag.
</p>

<p>
He blew out the light and for several moments
there was silence and each boy knew that the other
was in communication with Him who is conscious
of the sparrow's fall.
</p>

<p>
Although very tired it was long before Bob slept.
Over and over again he asked himself what could
have happened to Lucky, and as often came the
thought that it must have been something very
serious or he would have returned.  He could tell
by the sound of Jack's breathing that he was asleep
and he was glad.  That the storm was increasing in
violence he knew and the knowledge that it might
last for days added to his worry.  Finally he was
almost off when the faint, but unmistakable howl of
a wolf, far off on the mountain side, brought him
wide awake.
</p>

<p>
"One would think we had trouble enough without
that," he thought.
</p>

<p>
But second thought convinced him that they
really had little to fear from wolves.  The fire would
keep them away and even though they should brave
that they had their guns and plenty of ammunition.
So he put that thought from his mind and soon was
asleep.  How long he slept he did not know, but it
must have been several hours for he could not see
the reflection from the fire as he reached out and
pulled aside a branch from one of the thick boughs.
The wind was howling with almost demoniacal fury
and, as he listened a moment, above the noise of the
storm came the dismal howl of a wolf and he knew
that the animal must be near.
</p>

<p>
"Was that a wolf?" Jack cried as he caught hold
of Bob's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Guess so."
</p>

<p>
"What time is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Five o'clock," Bob told him after a glance at the
luminous dial of his wrist watch.
</p>

<p>
"Reckon the fire's about out, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Must be.  I'll go out and build it up."
</p>

<p>
"Think its safe?" Jack asked as another howl
reached their ears.
</p>

<p>
"Sure.  They're not that near and I'll take my
gun."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Bob was already out of his bag and creeping
from the tepee and what Jack said was lost in the
fury of the storm.  As soon as he was on his feet he
saw that only a small bed of coals remained of the
fire.
</p>

<p>
"And the snow would have put them out if it
wasn't for the protection of that cliff," he thought as
he hurried to where they had piled the supply of
wood.  "I'll have to get in some more wood
tomorrow whatever happens," he muttered as he noted
the small amount left.
</p>

<p>
The fire was so low that it took him some little
time to get it to blazing again, but he finally
accomplished it with the aid of some light stuff and had
turned to get more when an angry snarl caused him
to glance over the fire.  There, about thirty feet
from where he stood, but plainly visible in the light
of the fire, was the largest wolf he had ever seen.  It
was evident that the great beast feared the blaze and
dared not approach nearer, but it was also clear that
it was loath to retreat.  So it stood there baring its
cruel fangs and uttering snarl after snarl.
</p>

<p>
Bob had stood his rifle against a tree only three or
four feet from where he was and in another instant
it was in his hand and he was pressing the trigger.
Had it been daylight it would have been an easy shot
but the flickering fire must have disturbed his aim for
the wolf, with an angry snarl, either of rage or
pain, he was not sure which, turned and bounded off
into the forest.
</p>

<p>
"Missed him," Bob groaned in disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get him?"
</p>

<p>
He barely caught the words.
</p>

<p>
"No, I missed him, but he's gone."
</p>

<p>
"Hurry up, he may be back."
</p>

<p>
"There's no danger.  I'll be in in a minute."
</p>

<p>
But it was some time before he had the fire going
to his satisfaction and he would not leave it before.
He could hear, now and then, the snarl or howl of
the beasts and knew that there must be quite a
number of them around but, although he kept close
watch, he saw no more and, finally, he crept back into
the tepee.
</p>

<p>
"Many of them?" Jack asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"There's a few, but the fire'll keep them off."
</p>

<p>
"How'd you miss?"
</p>

<p>
"Reckon the fire threw my aim off.  It was a good
shot."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you hit him at all?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  He sounded as though he was
kinder disappointed."
</p>

<p>
"Probably had his mind made up for a good meal,"
Jack chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he isn't going to get it off us," Bob assured
him.
</p>

<p>
"You go to sleep and I'll wake you if there's any
need."
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with the other way around?"
</p>

<p>
"No, you need it and I don't.  You've been doing
all the work and may have to do it all for a day or
two longer if this bum ankle of mine gets to cutting
up."
</p>

<p>
"How does it feel?"
</p>

<p>
"Pretty good.  But will you do as I say?"
</p>

<p>
"I would if I could, but the sleep's all knocked
out of me and I couldn't go to sleep if my life
depended on it."
</p>

<p>
"All right then, we'll talk."
</p>

<p>
"You'd better sleep."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't do it."
</p>

<p>
"You mean it?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure do.  I'm not a bit sleepy."
</p>

<p>
"All right, I'll be glad of your company."
</p>

<p>
"How's the storm?"
</p>

<p>
"It's still snowing."
</p>

<p>
"Hard as ever?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid so but, to tell the truth, I didn't pay
much attention to it."
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't seem to be blowing quite so hard."
</p>

<p>
When Bob's watch told him it was seven o'clock
he declared that he was going to get breakfast
wolves or no wolves.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't heard them for the last half hour and
they've probably gone," he told Jack.
</p>

<p>
The wind was still blowing a gale and the snow
was driving with unbated fury outside, but within
the fringe of trees it was not so bad and, after he
had replenished the fire with almost the last of the
wood, he got the meat from where he had hung it
in a tree and cut off two thick steaks.  Then he
melted some snow and mixed up a batch of
flapjacks with the water as the condensed milk was all
gone.
</p>

<p>
"Venison steak and flapjacks," he announced a
half hour later as he brought the food in to Jade.
"What more could you want?"
</p>

<p>
"A cup of coffee."
</p>

<p>
"That would go good, but we'll have to make out
without it this morning, I reckon."
</p>

<p>
After they had eaten, Bob made an examination of
the injured ankle and was gratified to find that the
swelling had nearly vanished.
</p>

<p>
"Is it very sore?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not so very.  Let's see if I can stand on it."
</p>

<p>
"Better wait a bit."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No buts.  You'll only injure it if you tax it
now."
</p>

<p>
Jack knew that Bob was speaking the truth and
did not press the point.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think, Bob, that you ought to go hunt
for Lucky?" he asked a little later.
</p>

<p>
"And leave you here?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd be all right."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not so sure about that."
</p>

<p>
"But the wolves have gone and they're not likely
to return very soon."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've got to get some more wood in first
anyhow, so we won't decide till that's done and
perhaps he'll be back then."
</p>

<p>
The sun would not be up for another two hours or
more, but it was not so dark that he felt obliged to
wait.  But once outside the fringe of trees where the
full strength of the storm struck him, he doubted
his ability to accomplish his purpose.  But he knew
that there was plenty of dead wood where they had
been working before and it was only a short distance
away.  At every step he sank nearly to his waist and,
before he had gone twenty feet, he decided he had
better go back and put on his snow-shoes.  Fortunately
the wind was directly in his face and he
knew that, although it took about all his strength to
make headway against it, it would be of great help
when it came to dragging the wood back.
</p>

<p>
"I'd never be able to drag much of a stick against
this wind," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
He remembered a large spruce which had fallen a
little to the right of where they had obtained the
wood before and which they had not touched and
he felt sure that, could he but find it, he could get
enough to at least last through the day and the next
night.
</p>

<p>
He located the tree without much trouble and was
glad to see that the snow was not quite up to the
trunk.  This made it comparatively easy to chop off
the thick branches and he set to work after standing
his rifle, which he had not dared to leave behind,
against the butt of the tree.  He forced himself to
work with exceeding care as he well knew the danger
of a slip of the axe under the circumstances and
should he cut himself they would be in a plight ten
times more serious than at present.  When he judged
that he had cut as much as he could drag he hastened
the butts of the branches together with a piece of
rope and, picking up his rifle, started back.  It was
only a little over a hundred feet back to the fire, but
he was all but winded by the time he got there with
his load.
</p>

<p>
"Coming along fine," he shouted sticking his head
into the tepee before starting back for a second load.
</p>

<p>
"How's the storm?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"Still humming."
</p>

<p>
"No sign of a let up?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet."
</p>

<p>
While working Bob had been trying to make up
his mind what he ought to do.  Lucky was undoubtedly
in trouble and he felt that he ought to go
to his aid in case he could find him.  Then, on the
other hand, was his duty to his brother.  Would it
be safe to leave him in his present condition?
Suppose the wolves should come back while he was gone
and make an attack on him.  He shuddered as he
thought what might result in case he was not able
to keep them off.  Then again, suppose something
should happen to him and he be unable to get back.
Jack would surely die and again a shudder ran
through him.  It was a situation which sorely taxed
his mind, and he was unable to decide where his
duty lay.
</p>

<p>
He had dragged in his third load and was back at
the tree and about to start cutting again when he
heard a sound which sent the blood racing through
his body.  At first he thought it was a wolf and then,
as it came again, he knew he had been mistaken.
</p>

<p>
"That's Lightning, or I'm a Dutchman," he cried
as he put his hands up to his mouth and gave a loud
yell.
</p>

<p>
The yell was answered almost at once in the welcome
tones of Lucky's voice and for an instant Bob
raised his eyes and thanked God.  Then, grabbing
up his rifle, he hastened back and burst through the
fringe of trees just as the dog team swept around
the farther end.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God," he cried and the next minute he was
hugging the Indian as though he never intended to
let him go.
</p>

<p>
"Whar Jack?" the Indian asked as soon as he
could speak.
</p>

<p>
"I'm in here," Jack called out.
</p>

<p>
"He sprained his ankle yesterday," Bob explained.
</p>

<p>
"Dat bad, but I tank Le Bon Dieu you safe."
</p>

<p>
By this time he was inside the tepee where he
received a welcome fully as warm as Bob's.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get the stuff?" Jack asked after a bit.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, I geet heem."
</p>

<p>
"But what made you gone so long?"
</p>

<p>
"That can wait, Jack," Bob broke in.  "Can't you
see he's tired and hungry?"  Then, turning to the
Indian, he said: "Now you lie down here in your
bag and I'll see to the dogs and get you something
to eat."
</p>

<p>
But the Indian would not hear to it insisting that
he was all right although he acknowledged that he
was pretty hungry.
</p>

<p>
"Then you see to the dogs and I'll get you something
to eat.  We got a buck yesterday and I reckon
you can get outside a good sized steak."
</p>

<p>
"Oui, I eat heem ver' quick."
</p>

<p>
Bob had the steak cooking in almost no time and
Lucky declared that it was the best thing he had ever
eaten.  As soon as he had finished they went inside
the tepee where Jack was waiting impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Thought you'd never come," he growled.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Lucky, tell us all about it."
</p>

<p>
"Oui, Injun tell.  Injun geet up with heem leetle
past noon.  Heem goin' ver' fast, but Injun's dog
heem go faster, oui.  Heem no hear me till I geet
most up to heem.  Then heem see an' mak' to draw
gun, but Injun have gun out an' Injun tell heem
hand up or heem geet keel queek.
</p>

<p>
"And I'll bet he put 'em up in a hurry," Jack said
as Lucky paused.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, heem put um up."
</p>

<p>
"Then what?" Bob asked as he paused again.
</p>

<p>
"Injun come close an' mak' heem put stuff back
on sled.  Heem ver' mad' an' watch ver' close chance
to geet&mdash;what you call um&mdash;drop, but heem no geet."
</p>

<p>
"I'll bet he didn't."
</p>

<p>
"Keep still and let him tell the story," Bob ordered.
</p>

<p>
"When heem stuff all put on my sled Injun tell
heem start off ver' queek.  Tell heem no look back an
heem ver' glad go heem see heem no geet drop on
Injun.  Injun watch heem till heem geet long ways
off an' then Injun turn heem dog around an' we start
back."
</p>

<p>
"What time was that?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Now, who's interrupting?" Jack demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Eet 'bout ein o'clock.  All go bon till we geet most
half way back an' then that Slack dog heem geet seek,
ver' seek, an' we have stop.  Injun no know what
matter with dog.  Heem act like heem got belly
ache ver' bad.  Got no medicine so have to rub heem
belly ver' long time an' tink mebby heem goin' die.
Injun no want dog die, dey too bon dog.  So keep
on rubbin' an' when eet begin geet dark dog begin
geet better, but heem still some seek.  So put heem
on sled an' start, but een leetle while Pete dog heem
geet seek and have stop rub heem long time.  When
heem geet better have go ver' slow an' begin snow,
have go slow some more.  No geet here till leetle
while ago.  But Injun geet here."
</p>

<p>
"You bet you did," Jack burst out.
</p>

<p>
"How ankle?  Heem ver' bad?"
</p>

<p>
"It's coming along fine now.  Reckon I can walk
on it tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not so sure about that," Bob said with a
shake of his head.
</p>

<p>
"How long's this storm going to last, Lucky?"
Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"No can tell.  Mebby not ver' long."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why it doesn't make a continuous
performance of it and be done with it.  Then one would
know what to expect," Jack growled.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be pessimistic," Bob advised.  "Now that
Lucky's back we can stand a little snow, I reckon."
</p>

<p>
"A little, yes, but who said anything about a little?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, a lot then."
</p>

<p>
"That's a lot better."
</p>

<p>
"You no walk on that foot tomorrow I tink."
</p>

<p>
"But I could ride for awhile and we could go
slow."
</p>

<p>
"Mebby, eef snow not too mooch.  We see mornin'
heem come."
</p>

<p>
It seemed good to have a variety of food once
more and they made a bit of a feast of the dinner
opening a number of things which they had been
saving for some special occasion.  In the short
afternoon they cut some more wood and dragged it in and
as darkness was falling the storm showed signs of
breaking.
</p>

<p>
"Eet be bon day tomorrow," Lucky announced
while they were eating supper.
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll be off," Jack declared.
</p>

<p>
"Mebby, see how um foot be in morning."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
VISITORS.
</h3>

<p>
As Lucky had predicted the storm blew itself out
during the night and the stars were shining in a
clear sky when they ate breakfast shortly after seven
o'clock.
</p>

<p>
"How um foot feel?" Lucky asked when the meal
was over.
</p>

<p>
"Fine's a fiddle," Jack assured him and to convince
him that he was telling the truth he took a
few steps with only a slight limp.
</p>

<p>
"You no can walk on foot today.  Mebby tomorrow, oui."
</p>

<p>
"Sure I can.  Why it doesn't hurt hardly any."
</p>

<p>
"Lucky's right, old man, and you know it.  As
long as it hurts at all it would be foolish to think of
trying to walk on snow-shoes," Bob added.
</p>

<p>
"But couldn't I ride on the sled?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"No can do.  Too mooch snow mak' eet too hard
for dog.  Eet keel um."
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course, I don't want to do anything like
that, but I sure do hate to be wasting time here.  By
the time we get up there we'll probably find they've
left for the North Pole."
</p>

<p>
"Then it'll be the North Pole for us," Bob
chuckled.
</p>

<p>
During the day Jack growled off and on at the
enforced delay although he knew that the Indian was
quite right.  But the ankle was improving rapidly,
thanks to Bob's treatment, and he was resolved that
it should not keep them from starting out the next
morning.
</p>

<p>
The next morning came at last and, although the
Indian shook his head and Bob advised waiting
over another day, Jack insisted that the ankle would
stand it and, against their better judgment, they
finally gave in.
</p>

<p>
"You no keep on that ankle heem hurt," Lucky
ordered as, shortly after eight o'clock, they were all
ready to go.  "That ankle heem no strong an' you
hurt heem some more mebby you no use heem again
for ver' long time."
</p>

<p>
The weather had continued warmer than was
usual and the snow, which had been heavy when it
fell, had settled rapidly and was so well packed in
most places that the dogs sank in but a little and
the sled hardly at all.
</p>

<p>
"Eet ver' bon snow-shoen'," Lucky said after they
were fairly on the way.
</p>

<p>
"You bet," Bob replied.  Then, turning to Jack,
he asked: "Does that ankle hurt any?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing to speak of," Jack assured him.  "Of
course, I know I've got one."
</p>

<p>
"You tak' heem easy.  I tink snow packed 'nough
so you can ride some on sled when you geet tired,"
Lucky told him.
</p>

<p>
"I'll let you know when I want to ride," Jack
assured them.
</p>

<p>
The Indian had set a slow pace, knowing that
Jack would not be able to maintain a fast one for
any length of time, and it was nearly ten o'clock
when they reached the scene of the accident and
retrieved the meat which Bob had cached there.
</p>

<p>
Lucky had estimated that they had made about
twenty-five miles when they stopped for the night
shortly after five o'clock.  It had been dark for
several hours, but not dark enough to prevent them
from traveling.  Jack had rode a good part of the
way although he had protested strongly every time
Lucky or Bob had proposed it, and his ankle was in
fairly good shape although he confessed that "it
didn't feel as good as new."
</p>

<p>
"But another night's rest will fix it all right," he
assured them.
</p>

<p>
All day their way had led through the defile
between the two ranges of mountains and, for the most
part, they had been ascending although at no time
had the way been at all steep.  They were off to an
early start the next morning resolved to make a long
day of it, provided Jack's ankle permitted, and when
the sun showed itself over the top of the mountain,
Lucky declared they had covered not less than fifteen
miles.  Jack had walked nearly all the time, resorting
to the sled only a couple of times and then only for
short distances.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after noon they emerged from the defile
and found, stretching out before them and sloping
gently downward, an unbroken waste of snow reaching
as far as they could see.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!" Bob burst out.  "How are we ever
going to keep a straight course across all that?"
</p>

<p>
"We ought to have a compass," Jack added.
</p>

<p>
"Mebby heem not so far heem look," Lucky told
them.  "Eet ver' what you call hazy.  Mebby not
ver' far 'cross."
</p>

<p>
"Here's hoping," Bob told him.
</p>

<p>
His hope was realized for just as it was beginning
to get dark they sighted a thick growth of trees and
in another hour they were once more traveling
through woods.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure we're on the right trail, Lucky?"
Bob asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Oui.  I tink so.  Eskimo heem tell me whar go."
</p>

<p>
"But how do you know that he was telling the
truth.  Any man who would do what he did wouldn't
hesitate to lie."
</p>

<p>
"Mebby heem lie."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose the only way to find out is to
keep on."
</p>

<p>
"Oui, that only way."
</p>

<p>
How the Indian could keep anything like a
straight course through the deep forest, in which
they were now traveling, and where he had never
been before, was a mystery to the boys.  But he
never hesitated as he led the way and they knew
they were making good time.  It was about half
past five when he finally called a halt for the night
and both boys were glad to hear the order, Jack
especially as his ankle, which was still far from
being strong, had been giving him considerable pain
during the last hour.
</p>

<p>
"We mak' eet tomorrow, mebby," Lucky told
them as he set about making the dogs comfortable
for the night.
</p>

<p>
The temperature had been falling ever since morning
and now the mercury in their thermometer stood
thirty degrees below zero and was still falling.
</p>

<p>
"It's going to be a bit cold around the edges
tonight," Bob declared as he took the axe and started
to hunt for firewood.
</p>

<p>
"Bet she'll go to forty," Jack agreed.
</p>

<p>
"How cold you ever know it to get up here,
Lucky?" he asked a little later as they were sitting
around the fire eating supper.
</p>

<p>
"'Bout feefty-five, mebby seexty."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope it doesn't break that record while
we're up here," Bob laughed.
</p>

<p>
They reached Colville River soon after dark the
following day and made camp in a thick clump of
trees close to the bank.
</p>

<p>
"Wonder if there's any fish in this river?" Jack
asked.
</p>

<p>
"I 'spect um thar, but you find eet plenty hard
work cut hole een ice," Lucky told him.
</p>

<p>
"Do you fellows want some fresh fish for supper
enough to do the work here while I'm trying to get
some?"
</p>

<p>
"Go to it," Bob told him.
</p>

<p>
If he had realized what it meant to get a hole
through the ice it is doubtful if Jack would have
proposed fish for supper, but once started he was
resolved not to give up.  But it was all of an hour
and a half from the time he started before he was
ready to drop in his line.  However he felt amply
repaid when he carried six good sized salmon back
to camp.
</p>

<p>
"You got 'em," Bob greeted him.
</p>

<p>
"Sure did, but I thought I'd hit the bottom of the
river before I struck water," Jack told him.
</p>

<p>
"How thick is the ice?"
</p>

<p>
"Must be nearly three feet and there's about four
feet of snow on top of that."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you ought to have a medal."
</p>

<p>
The fish proved a very welcome addition to their
rations and they had a good, if a rather late, supper.
</p>

<p>
"Do we go up or down from here?" Bob asked a
little later.
</p>

<p>
"Up," Lucky replied.
</p>

<p>
"But have you any idea how far from here they
are?"
</p>

<p>
"Not mooch.  That man heem say only leetle way
from whar we strike river."
</p>

<p>
"Then we ought to find them tomorrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Mebby.  No can tell."
</p>

<p>
Lucky and Bob had dug a hole in the snow and
had covered the bottom with an extra thick layer of
spruce boughs as the night bid fair to be the coldest
they had yet encountered.  The sleeping room, as
Jack dubbed it, was long enough to permit a good
sized fire to be built at one end and, as the walls were
nearly five feet high, it was really cozy by the time
they were ready to turn in.
</p>

<p>
"Forty-eight below," Bob announced as he glanced
at the thermometer just before crawling into his bag.
</p>

<p>
"I should worry," Jack, who had been "in bed"
for some moments, chuckled.
</p>

<p>
Jack was a sound sleeper and seldom awoke during
the night unless disturbed.  But this night it seemed
to him that he had hardly fallen asleep when he
awoke with a sudden start.  For a moment he lay
wondering what had happened.  He could hear Bob
breathing steadily on one side of him while the
Indian was snoring quietly on the other, and knew they
were both sleeping.  The fire had died down to a
bed of coals by which he knew that he had been
asleep for some hours at least.  He was about to
shut his eyes again, convinced that he had awakened
without cause, when a low threatening growl reached
his ears.
</p>

<p>
"That's Lightning," he thought as he strained his
ears again.
</p>

<p>
For some moments he heard no other sound and
drowsiness was stealing over him when the sharp
snap of a twig brought him wide awake.  Reaching
over he touched his brother lightly.
</p>

<p>
"S-s-s-s-h.  Listen," he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" Bob breathed.
</p>

<p>
"There's something or someone out there."
</p>

<p>
"I don't hear a thing," Bob whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Listen."
</p>

<p>
"I hear it now," as another twig snapped, answered
by an angry snarl from one of the dogs which
awoke Lucky.
</p>

<p>
"What matter with dog?" he whispered as soon
as he saw that the boys were awake.
</p>

<p>
"There's something prowling around the camp,"
Bob told him.
</p>

<p>
"Injun go see."
</p>

<p>
"Reckon we'd better all go," Bob said as he began
to squirm out of his bag.
</p>

<p>
There was only a small rim of the moon showing,
but the sky was filled with stars and it was not dark.
In fact Bob could see for some distance through the
woods as he carefully raised his eyes over the edge
of the snow.  At first he saw nothing to cause him
any alarm, but after a moment of watching he caught
sight of a shadowy form stealing from behind a
large tree about thirty feet away to the security of
another some ten feet nearer.
</p>

<p>
"It's a man," he whispered.  "And there's another
and another," he added a moment later.
</p>

<p>
The dogs were now growling almost continually.
</p>

<p>
"What'll we do?" Jack whispered.
</p>

<p>
"We wait, see what um do," Lucky whispered back.
</p>

<p>
"How many have you seen?"
</p>

<p>
"Six so far," Bob whispered, and a moment later
added: "They're working around where the dogs
are."
</p>

<p>
"That no go," Lucky growled.  "Mebby um keel
dog."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the Indian leaped to the edge of the
snow and shouted:
</p>

<p>
"Who you, eh?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment there was silence broken only by
the snarls of the dogs, then, from behind a tree, only
about ten feet from where he stood, stepped a man.
The boys could see that it was a man of large frame
standing well over six feet, but it was not light
enough to guess at his nationality until he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Who you?"
</p>

<p>
"He's a breed," Bob whispered in Jack's ear.
</p>

<p>
"What you want in night here?" Lucky snapped
the question in a tone they had never before heard
him use.
</p>

<p>
"You name Lareux?" the man asked ignoring
Lucky's question.
</p>

<p>
"Non."
</p>

<p>
"What ees eet?"
</p>

<p>
"Hogan, Lucky Hogan."
</p>

<p>
"Dat sound Irish.  You Irish?  You no talk Irish."
</p>

<p>
"No Irish.  Me Injun."
</p>

<p>
"Your name Irish, you talk lik' breed an' say you
Injun.  Eet too mooch.  You step out here whar I
geet good look.  You try funny beesness an' my
man heem shoot."
</p>

<p>
For an moment Lucky hesitated as though trying
to make up his mind whether or not to obey the
order.
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead, Lucky," Bob whispered.  "I've got
him covered."
</p>

<p>
"My man heem got you on de sight," Lucky said
as he took a few steps forward in the deep snow.
</p>

<p>
The other, who was on snow-shoes, advanced to
meet him and in a moment they were close together.
The stranger carried a rifle, but he bore it over his
shoulder as though he had no idea of using it at
present.  On his snow-shoes he towered nearly two
feet above Lucky.
</p>

<p>
"You no Lareux," the boys heard him say.
</p>

<p>
"Who heem?" Lucky asked.
</p>

<p>
"Heem ver' bad mans.  Heem keel one of my
mans an' we hunt heem."
</p>

<p>
"When heem keel heem?"
</p>

<p>
"Tree, mebby four day ago," the stranger
answered somewhat evasively Bob thought.
</p>

<p>
"Where you leeve, eh?" Lucky asked after a
pause of a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Up nor'."
</p>

<p>
"How far?"
</p>

<p>
"What for you ask question so mooch?"  It was
plain that the man was rapidly loosening his patience
of which he probably had no great store.
</p>

<p>
"You ask first," Lucky told him pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
"Dat my beesness."
</p>

<p>
"Mine too."
</p>

<p>
"How many mans you got?"
</p>

<p>
"Some.  How many you?"
</p>

<p>
"You see some man yes'day?" the stranger next
asked without replying to the question.
</p>

<p>
"Non."
</p>

<p>
"Day 'fore dat?"
</p>

<p>
"Non."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  We go now.  You no man we want."
</p>

<p>
He turned and stole silently back into the forest
and the boys could see others slipping from behind
trees and following him.
</p>

<p>
"What do you make of it?" Bob asked as soon as
the Indian was back in the "bed room."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Lucky hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Injun no like dat man," he finally said.
</p>

<p>
"You think he's no good?"
</p>

<p>
"Mebby.  Injun tink heem&mdash;what you call heem?&mdash;one
beeg bluff."
</p>

<p>
"You mean you think he was after us and not
that man he mentioned?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui."
</p>

<p>
"Then why did he leave?"
</p>

<p>
"Heem heap big coward.  Heem no know how
many here."
</p>

<p>
"You think he'll come back?"
</p>

<p>
"Mebby.  No can tell."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's after three o'clock now.  I reckon we'd
better keep an eye open, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Injun watch.  White boys go sleep."
</p>

<p>
But both declared they had had enough sleep and
could not go to sleep again anyway, so they built
up the fire and, for the next two hours the Indian
entertained them with his stories of which he seemed
to have an inexhaustable supply.  But every few
minutes one or the other would get up and take a
look around, not that they thought it at all likely
that they would return so soon, but they wanted to be
on the safe side.
</p>

<p>
"How about eats?" Bob asked when his watch
told him that it was nearly six o'clock.
</p>

<p>
"You wait leetle minute," Lucky said as he got to
his feet.
</p>

<p>
"What you going to do?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Injun scout 'round leetle 'fore we geet eats.  Mebby
they hide somewhere, take shot, oui."
</p>

<p>
"You'll be careful?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui.  Injun look out ver' queek."
</p>

<p>
While talking the Indian had jumped out of the
hole and was fastening on his snow-shoes.
</p>

<p>
"You no geet out till Injun come back," he ordered.
</p>

<p>
"You're the boss," Jack told him and the next
moment he was gone.
</p>

<p>
"Hope he isn't gone long," Bob said as he sat
down again.
</p>

<p>
"He seems to think of everything," Jack said.
"You and I would have gone right out and started
breakfast and made a fine target of ourselves
without giving it a thought."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Probably."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps what?" Jack snapped.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, probably," Bob laughed and Jack joined
in.
</p>

<p>
A half hour passed and they were beginning to
get uneasy when the Indian returned.
</p>

<p>
"All gone," he announced.
</p>

<p>
"Good.  Now we can get something to eat and,
believe me, I'm about starved."
</p>

<p>
"Same here," Jack added.
</p>

<p>
"Now we got be mighty careful," Lucky cautioned
as they were about to start off up the river an hour
later.
</p>

<p>
"You think they may be coming back?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"No can tell.  We&mdash;what you call heem?&mdash;play
heem safe."
</p>

<p>
"You bet," Jack declared.  "That's my motto,
'play safe'."
</p>

<p>
"Since when?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Since&mdash;since&mdash;well, since I got a good look at
that half-breed," Jack stammered.
</p>

<p>
"I thought it was of recent origin."
</p>

<p>
They had intended to travel on the river as it was
much easier than through the woods, but Lucky told
them it would be safer to keep to the woods declaring
that they would make altogether too good a mark
out in the open.
</p>

<p>
"Injun goin' keep leetle way ahead an' white boys
follow heem track.  No can geet lost."
</p>

<p>
"No, but you can get shot," Bob said soberly.
</p>

<p>
"Injun no geet shot.  Injun got eyes."
</p>

<p>
"I'll say you have," Jack testified.
</p>

<p>
When all was ready the Indian ordered them to
give him a start of five minutes and then to come on
with the team.  Both boys had, during the trip, taken
turns at driving the dogs and, although they still
lacked much of Lucky's skill, they could manage
very well.  The Indian took a course nearer the
river than that taken by their visitors of the night so
they had no trouble in following his tracks.
</p>

<p>
"Hope he don't get too far away," Bob said as
he gave the order to mush.
</p>

<p>
They had been on the way a little over an hour
when, suddenly, the sound of a rifle shot broke the
silence of the forest.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" Bob cried as he ordered the dogs
to halt.
</p>

<p>
"There's no doubt about what it was," Jack
answered.  "The big question is why?"
</p>

<p>
"Was it Lucky's rifle, do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't know."
</p>

<p>
They listened for a moment or two but there was
no other shot.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe he shot at a deer or something," Jack
suggested.
</p>

<p>
"If he did he'll be coming back in a minute because
he'll know we won't know what to make of it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if he doesn't show up pretty soon I'm going
on.  Perhaps he's in trouble."
</p>

<p>
"We'll wait five minutes," Bob said glancing at his
watch.
</p>

<p>
The five minutes were just up when they caught
sight of the Indian coming toward them at a rapid
lope.
</p>

<p>
"What's up?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Did you shoot?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"No shoot, geet shoot at," he told them.
</p>

<p>
"One of those fellows?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Injun 'spect so, no see um."
</p>

<p>
"Tell us about it," Jack said as Lucky paused.
</p>

<p>
"Not mooch tell.  Injun go 'long like when bang
go gun, but no geet heet, so come back."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what'll we do?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think he meant to hit you?" Jack asked
before the Indian could reply to Bob's question.
</p>

<p>
"Tink heem mean scare Injun.  No hear bullet."
</p>

<p>
"Then I move we go on.  I don't belive they intend
to kill us and anyhow they can do it about as
well in one place as another up here if that's what
they are after."
</p>

<p>
"What do you think, Lucky?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"We run dey catch us, we stay here dey find us
yer' queek.  Mebby we go on."
</p>

<p>
But as it happened it was not left for them to
decide for just then another shot rang out followed
by the thud of a bullet as it buried itself in the trunk
of a tree over Jack's head.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, what's the big idea?" he shouted.
</p>

<p>
In answer to the question a man, whom they all
recognized as their visitor of the night before,
stepped out from behind a tree about thirty feet
away.  Instantly Bob had him covered with his rifle.
</p>

<p>
"No shoot," the man cried.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" Bob demanded.  "You've had two
shots at us."
</p>

<p>
"No shoot to hit."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that last one was a bit too close for comfort,"
Bob told him still keeping his rifle leveled.
</p>

<p>
"My mans all 'round you.  You shoot we keel all."
</p>

<p>
"That's different."  Bob lowered his gun as he had
little doubt, but that the man was speaking the truth.
"What do you want with us?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
Instead of replying to the question the breed
stepped forward after giving a shrill whistle.  Then
they saw that he had indeed spoken the truth for
instantly, from all sides, five other men stepped from
behind the trees and came toward them.
</p>

<p>
"Some reception," Jack whispered.
</p>

<p>
"You come wid us," the big man ordered as he
motioned to his men to start north.
</p>

<p>
"What's the idea?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"Huh?" The man snapped.
</p>

<p>
"I mean what are you going to do with us?"
</p>

<p>
"You find dat out later."
</p>

<p>
"But I want to know now."
</p>

<p>
Jack was never one to be bossed unless the one
who did it had a good right and he was mad clear
through.
</p>

<p>
"No geet heem mad now," Lucky whispered and
taking the hint, Jack added:
</p>

<p>
"All right, have it your own way.  I reckon you're
the doctor."
</p>

<p>
"Huh?"
</p>

<p>
"I said you're the big boss."
</p>

<p>
"Oui, me boss."  It was clear that the man was
pleased with the acknowledgment.  "You do what
me say no geet hurt.  Try funny beesness an' you
better not."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon you're right," Jack assured him.
</p>

<p>
He ordered them to follow after his men and
he brought up the rear keeping a few yards behind
them.
</p>

<p>
"What do you make of it, Bob?" Jack whispered
after they had gone a short distance.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't an idea, but we'll probably find out
sooner or later."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon."
</p>

<p>
They noted that they were traveling in a direction
which made an angle of some forty-five degrees with
the river and the way was up a gentle rise for more
than an hour.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, when they were nearly to the top of the
hill, a large but low log cabin loomed up ahead.
</p>

<p>
"Guess we're there," Bob said in a low tone.
</p>

<p>
"You mean here, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"It's all the same."
</p>

<p>
The five men, all breeds, were standing about the
door, as they came up, as if awaiting further orders
from their leader.  He spoke some words to them, in
a French dialect, which the boys, although they were
fairly conversant with the language, failed to
understand, but it was evidently an order for one of them
to show the Indian where he was to stable the dogs.
The man motioned for Lucky to follow him around
back of the cabin and, without a word, he drove the
team after him.  The leader pushed open the door
and, after slipping off his snow-shoes, told the boys
to enter.
</p>

<p>
The cabin was roughly but almost luxuriantly
furnished and consisted of at least two rooms.  The
front room, in which they found themselves, contained
a large massive table in the center and a half
dozen roughly built, but comfortable easy chairs,
four of them being rockers.  A huge fireplace
occupied nearly the whole of one end while the side
away from the door was lined with bunks.  Several
bear and deer skins were on the floor and above the
fireplace an enormous moose head was fastened to
the logs, the antlers touching the top of the room.
Many skins of different animals adorned the walls.
Altogether it was a most homelike appearing room
and, for a moment, the boys gazed about spellbound.
</p>

<p>
"Nice place you have here," Jack finally declared.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, eet ver' bon," their host replied evidently
pleased with the praise.
</p>

<p>
"Did you build it?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Non, me no build heem."
</p>

<p>
"Bought it, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Non, no buy heem."
</p>

<p>
Evidently the man did not intend to enlighten
them as to the means by which he had secured possession
of the cabin and Bob quickly decided that it
would not be wise to press the matter.  Instead he
asked:
</p>

<p>
"Are we to consider ourselves prisoners?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment the man did not answer then, then
with a slight shrug of his massive shoulders, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Mebby."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by that?" Bob demanded.
</p>

<p>
"You geeve word you no try geet away you no
prisoner."
</p>

<p>
"And if we refuse?"
</p>

<p>
Again the man shrugged his shoulders.  "Den you
prisoner, oui."
</p>

<p>
"Then I reckon we'll have to be prisoners.  But
what's the idea?"
</p>

<p>
"Huh?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean why have you taken us prisoners?"
</p>

<p>
"You find dat out plenty time."
</p>

<p>
Before Bob could speak again the door opened and
Lucky, followed by the five breeds, entered the
room.  The Indian seemed as much astonished as
had the boys at the room, but they could see that
he was trying not to make any show of his astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Deese boy no promise not to geet away," the
leader said turning to Lucky.  "You mak' 'em
promise, oui?"
</p>

<p>
"Non."  The Indian shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Den we feex you so you no geet away."
</p>

<p>
"Mebby."
</p>

<p>
"For sure, no mebby."
</p>

<p>
Lucky shrugged his shoulders as much as to say
that the incident was closed so far as he was
concerned, and the leader turned to one of the men and
gave an order.
</p>

<p>
"You mak' home," he said not unpleasantly turning
again to Lucky and the boys who were standing
close together.  "Dinner be ready een jest leetle
while."
</p>

<p>
Evidently the big living-room served also for the
dining-room for the cover, a huge bear skin was
removed by one of the breeds and dishes substituted.
</p>

<p>
"Reckon they don't intend to starve us," Jack
whispered a little later as one of the breeds brought
in a huge roast of venison and placed it on the table.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they're going to eat and let us look on,"
Bob suggested.
</p>

<p>
But in this he was mistaken for, after the table
had been loaded with food of many varieties, they
were invited to sit up and eat.
</p>

<p>
"They've got a good chef that's sure," Jack
whispered soon after they started eating.
</p>

<p>
"Both as to quality and quantity," Bob agreed.
</p>

<p>
Great as was the quantity of food provided it
disappeared rapidly before the attack of the half-breeds
who ate voraciously and with little regard for table
etiquette.  There was no conversation except a
whispered word now and then between the two boys who
sat side by side.  The Indian, whether by accident or
design they could not tell, had been placed on the
other side of the table.  Two large logs were blazing
in the fireplace and, as Bob looked about the room,
he was reminded of the many tales he had read of
the old Norsemen and their crude, but rugged civilization.
It seemed that history had been turned back
a thousand years.
</p>

<p>
As soon as all had finished eating two of the men
began to clear the table while the others, with the
exception of the leader, began a game of cards at a
smaller table in one of the corners near the fire.
</p>

<p>
"What you do up here, eh?"
</p>

<p>
The leader shot the question at them so suddenly
that both boys gave a sudden start.  Bob cast a
questioning glance at Lucky and tried to read in his face
whether or not he ought to divulge the object of their
trip.  But the Indian's face gave no sign and, after
a moment's hesitation, he decided that it could do no
harm to tell him.
</p>

<p>
"We are looking for our uncle," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oui?  What heem name?"
</p>

<p>
"Lakewood.  Silas Lakewood."
</p>

<p>
"What heem do up here, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"He came up here from Nome some months ago
on a prospecting trip."
</p>

<p>
"He no geet back?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"What heem look like?"
</p>

<p>
"It will probably seem strange to you, but the fact
is we have never seen him," Bob replied and went on
to tell how it had all come about.
</p>

<p>
"Dat bon story," the man said when he had
finished.  "You say dat man's name what come wid
heem ees Long, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"That's it.  Have you seen them?"
</p>

<p>
The man slowly shook his head.  "Non, me no
see them."
</p>

<p>
A little later he joined the others at cards and the
three friends were left alone at the farther side of the
room where they could converse in low tones without
danger of being overheard.
</p>

<p>
"It's a queer thing that they haven't taken our
revolvers away from us," Bob declared.
</p>

<p>
"I was just thinking that same thing," Jack added.
"What's the matter with holding them up right
now?"
</p>

<p>
But the Indian shook his head as he whispered.
"Eet no go.  Dey watch us all the tam.  You reach
for gun an' they geet you first."
</p>

<p>
"He's right, Jack," Bob agreed.  "I have an idea
they wouldn't object to an excuse for shooting us.
We'd better sit tight for the present and play it safe."
</p>

<p>
"But I'll bet my last year's straw hat that that guy
was lying when he said he hadn't seen Uncle or Long.
Didn't you notice how he hesitated when you asked
him?"
</p>

<p>
"I did, and I think you're right about the lying.
He's seen them all right."
</p>

<p>
About an hour later the other two men came in
from the back room and joined in the game which
lasted until nearly six o'clock.  Then another two
set about getting supper while the others continued to
play.  Not a word had been said to the three prisoners
during the afternoon after their first conversation
with the leader and, to a casual observer, it
would have appeared that they were taking no notice
of them.  But they knew that not a single motion
escaped observation and they were very careful to
make no move which could possibly be interpreted
as hostile.
</p>

<p>
The supper, although not as elaborate as the
dinner, was a good one and, although they had eaten a
big dinner, they did it full justice.  The meal over
the game of cards was resumed and again the three
were left to their own resources.
</p>

<p>
"My, but this is getting monotonous," Jack declared
when a clock on the mantle over the fireplace
struck nine.  "If we only had something to read it
wouldn't be so bad."
</p>

<p>
But there was neither paper nor book anywhere in
the room so far as they could see.  But soon after
the game broke up and it was evident that bed time
had arrived.
</p>

<p>
"You geeve promise we no tie you up," the leader
said, crossing the room to their side.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing doing," Bob fold him without hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"Den we have tie you up."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon you'll have to do as you think best about
that."
</p>

<p>
"Geeve me you guns."
</p>

<p>
It was an order they had been expecting and, knowing
it would be useless to refuse, they complied, after
which the man searched each one carefully.  Then
he spoke a few words to one of his men who at once
left the room returning a few minutes later with
some pieces of rope about the size of clothesline.
</p>

<p>
"You geet een deese bunk," the man ordered pointing
at the end of the room away from the fireplace.
</p>

<p>
With no protest they complied and the man proceeded
to tie their hands behind their backs and their
feet together.  Then he covered them each with a
heavy blanket and said:
</p>

<p>
"You no be ver' bon sleep, but you no geeve
promise."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," Bob told him cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
"You geet cold you call an' me geet you more
blanket, oui."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks."
</p>

<p>
In another five minutes the lights had been
extinguished and only a feeble flicker from the dying
fire illuminated the room.  Bob had chosen the lowest
of the three bunks and he knew that Jack was
in the one next above while the Indian occupied the
top one.  He had expected they would be tied during
the night, but was not sure whether or not a watch
would be kept on them.  He had, for several years
together with Jack, practiced the art of freeing
himself from bonds and both boys were about as expert
at the trick as the Great Houdini himself.  During
the evening he had cautioned Jack to be on the watch
for the move so, while the man was tying their wrists
together both boys were straining every muscle in
order to get as much slack as possible when they
relaxed.  But Bob had sensed during the tying that
the man was no weakling at the job and he was not
at all sure that he could free his hands when the
time came.
</p>

<p>
For an hour he made no effort to get his hands free
and he had cautioned Jack to wait until he should
give him the signal.  When the clock struck eleven
he gave a slight cough which a moment later was
answered from the bunk above and he knew that
Jack understood.  He was certain that they had
stationed no watch, relying on the security of the ropes,
and he was also quite sure that they were all asleep
and he knew that, as a rule, these breeds were sound
sleepers.
</p>

<p>
From the feel of the rope about his wrists he knew
he was in for a long job even if he succeeded.
Although he had done his best there was mighty little
slack so tightly had the man tied the rope.  He hoped
that Jack had been able to secure more, but did not
dare whisper to find out.  The half hour struck and
he was still striving and about ready to give up the
task as impossible when he felt rather than heard
Jack slip from his bunk.
</p>

<p>
"You untied?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he got 'em too tight."
</p>

<p>
"I just made it and that's all."
</p>

<p>
With Jack's assistance his hands were soon free
and he quickly released his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Be careful when you wake Lucky," Jack whispered.
</p>

<p>
But, although the Indian had made no movement
he was wide awake and, as soon as Bob had freed his
hands and feet, he slipped to the floor beside them.
The room was in darkness as the fire had gone out
all but a few live coals which gave no light.
</p>

<p>
"Stay right here till I get the rifles," Bob ordered.
</p>

<p>
He knew that their rifles had been stood in a corner
to the right of the fire and he stepped across the
room in that direction his moccasins making not the
slightest sound.  In a moment he was back with the
guns and they lost no time in opening the door and
stepping outside.
</p>

<p>
"So far so good," Jack whispered with a sigh of
relief.
</p>

<p>
"Have they got any dogs?" Bob asked Lucky.
</p>

<p>
"I tink not.  Injun see no dog."
</p>

<p>
"Then we probably can get ours without making
any noise."
</p>

<p>
"Oui, I tink so."
</p>

<p>
"It would be a big item in our favor if we could
take all their rifles and revolvers away from them,"
Jack suggested as they moved away from the door.
</p>

<p>
"Too risky," Bob whispered.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think, Lucky?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"Bob right.  Eet too risky."
</p>

<p>
"You may be right but it seems to me that it
would be worth the risk for we'd then have them at
our mercy."
</p>

<p>
"But they'll sleep till six o'clock and that'll give us
about six hours' start."
</p>

<p>
"Start for where?"
</p>

<p>
"Gee, that's so.  Where are we going to start for?
We haven't found Uncle yet."
</p>

<p>
"And he's up here somewhere and something tells
me that that man Long has some kind of a connection
with this gang."  Jack declared as they reached
the rear of the cabin.
</p>

<p>
"And, of course, we can't go till we find him."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not."
</p>

<p>
That they were in a predicament was evident to
all.  To be sure they had made good their escape for
the time being, but they well knew that, as things
stood then, their recapture was only a matter of a
few hours and their captors would undoubtedly see to
it that they did not make their escape a second time.
If only their mission was completed and they could
leave at once, the chances were greatly in favor of a
complete get away, but, come what might, all three
were agreed that such action was out of the question.
While the men had, in a way, treated them kindly
they knew that they were men who would hesitate at
nothing to accomplish their purpose whatever that
might be.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we've got to do some tall thinking and do
it quick," Bob declared.  "What's your opinion,
Lucky?"
</p>

<p>
"We must no geet caught again."
</p>

<p>
"That's easy to say," Jack said.  "But how are
we going to help it?  We can't move a foot in this
snow without leaving tracks and they're six to our
three and in a rough and tumble we wouldn't be in
it for a minute."
</p>

<p>
"Oui, you heet eet."
</p>

<p>
"Then what can we do?  It seems to me that my
plan of getting all their weapons is the only thing
left for us."
</p>

<p>
"Eet ver' risky."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it's risky, but we've taken risks before."
</p>

<p>
"Their rifles are hanging on the walls and I reckon
we could get them easy enough," Bob said thoughtfully,
"but when it comes to their six guns it's a cat
of another color.  They've got them in their belts
and it would take a miracle to get them all without
waking any of them.  If it was only one or even
two it might be done, but six&mdash;it's practically
impossible."
</p>

<p>
"But not absolutely," Jack insisted.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what's your plan?"
</p>

<p>
"My idea is for all of us to go in and for one of
us to frisk them while the others stand guard with
the rifles ready.  If one of them wakes up we could
simply tell them that the first one to move out of his
bunk would get a hunk of lead in his skin."
</p>

<p>
"But it's dark in there and we couldn't see them
and they could shoot from their bunks," Bob objected.
</p>

<p>
"And that's where the risk comes in.  Mind I
didn't say it wasn't dangerous."
</p>

<p>
"Let's see," Bob mused aloud.  "They've probably
all got at least one gun and with our three it makes
nine and even then we couldn't be sure we had them
all.  What do you say, Lucky?"
</p>

<p>
"White boys stay out here an' Injun go in geet
guns."
</p>

<p>
"Not so you'd notice it," Jack broke in and Bob
agreed with him.
</p>

<p>
"But that the ver' best&mdash;" the Indian began, but
Bob interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"No use to argue on that line, old man.  Either
we all go in as Jack proposed, or we try some other
plan."
</p>

<p>
"And that's final," Jack added.
</p>

<p>
"If it was only light enough in there so that we
could keep them covered&mdash;" Bob began.
</p>

<p>
"But it isn't, so there's no use wishing it was,"
Jack interrupted.  "I tell you it's our only chance."
</p>

<p>
"And it's a mighty slim one."
</p>

<p>
"I grant you that but I still stick to it that it's the
thing to do.  The way I look at it is this, if one of
them wakes up and starts shooting the chances are
that he wouldn't hit us and, if it got too hot, we
could bolt the door and once outside we'd be no
worse off than we're going to be when they catch us
in the morning as they're going to do if we don't
get those guns."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, but you're right," Bob said slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so, Lucky?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, I t'ink heem heet eet."

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
LUCKY ACQUIRES AN ARSENAL.
</h3>

<p>
Bob was far from convinced that the move,
proposed by Jack, was a wise one but, for the life
of him, he was unable to suggest anything else and,
after a few more objections, he gave in.
</p>

<p>
"Who's going to do the frisking?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Injun do eet Injun ver' bon like that," Lucky
told them.
</p>

<p>
"All right then.  We'll stand guard and, mind now
both of you, if they start any shooting make for the
door as quickly as possible."
</p>

<p>
It was a desperate chance they were taking and
Bob's heart beat rapidly as they retraced their steps
and once more stood before the door.
</p>

<p>
"It's up to you, Lucky," he whispered as the
Indian reached out his hand to push the door open.
</p>

<p>
"Injun do heem best," Lucky whispered back.
</p>

<p>
"I know it," Bob assured him.
</p>

<p>
Another instant and they once more stood in the
room.  They could hear the heavy breathing of the
men and one of them was snoring loudly enough,
Jack afterward declared, to wake the dead.  The
two boys at once took their position by the big table
and the Indian approached the nearest of the bunks.
It was so dark that they were unable to see a hand
before their eyes, a fact that Bob was undecided
whether to regard as an advantage or otherwise.
Plenty of light would undoubtedly be to their
advantage should any of the men awake for it would
enable them to keep them quiet in their bunks, but a
little light, perhaps, would throw the advantage to
the other side.  Maybe, on the whole, it was just as
well that it was dark.  Not a sound save the breathing
of the men and the stentorion tones of the snorer
broke the silence.  Lucky was doing his work with
absolute silence and, as minute after minute passed,
Bob began to breath more easily.  Perhaps they
would succeed after all.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him that a long time had passed when
he felt a touch on his arm and he knew that Lucky
was thrusting revolvers into the pockets of his coat.
He longed to ask him if he was through, but did
not dare and then he knew he was not for he did not
give the signal to leave.  Carefully feeling with his
hands he counted six revolvers and wondered if he
had put any in Jack's pockets.  Then, suddenly, his
heart skipped a beat as he heard a movement in the
direction of the bunks.
</p>

<p>
"What de matter?" he heard one of the men
grumble.
</p>

<p>
He reached out a hand and touched Jack's arm as
a caution for him to keep silent.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you no let feller sleep?" came, in sleepy
tones from another bunk.
</p>

<p>
"What for you touch me den?"
</p>

<p>
"Me no touch you, you have de dream, oui."
</p>

<p>
"Shut up you feller," came in louder tones which
Bob recognized as the leader's.
</p>

<p>
Then all was still again.
</p>

<p>
"That was a narrow one," Bob thought.
</p>

<p>
The minutes passed and he wondered if the Indian
was again at his work.  He knew he would wait
some time to permit them to get to sleep again.  Then,
suddenly, he was conscious of a new sound which
seemed to come from the room at the rear.  It was
so slight a sound that he strained his ears uncertain
whether or not he had really heard anything.  It
sounded like a very feeble groan and was repeated
several times so that finally he was convinced that it
was no trick of imagination.
</p>

<p>
"There's someone in that room," he thought, and
wondered if Jack had heard it.
</p>

<p>
Would Lucky never finish?  It seemed to the
anxious boy that hours had passed since they had
re-entered the room when he at last felt a tug at his
sleeve and knew that the Indian was telling him that
it was over.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God," he breathed as he reached out his
hand and caught hold of Jack's arm.
</p>

<p>
A moment more and they were again outside.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get them all?" Bob whispered as soon
as they were well away from the door.
</p>

<p>
"No can tell.  Geet all could find."
</p>

<p>
"How many?"
</p>

<p>
"I t'ink ten."
</p>

<p>
"That's one apiece and one over," Jack said.  "Now
what do you think of my plan?"
</p>

<p>
"It turned out well, but if it hadn't&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Quit hanging crepe," Jack interrupted.  "They
didn't."
</p>

<p>
"But they came mighty near it."
</p>

<p>
"I'll say they did and I was just on the point of
ordering hands up when you touched me."
</p>

<p>
"It's a good think I touched you then."
</p>

<p>
"I'll say it was."
</p>

<p>
"Say, Jack, did you hear anything while in there?"
Bob asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Heard one fellow snoring if that's what you
mean."
</p>

<p>
"No.  I thought I heard something that seemed
to come from that back room."
</p>

<p>
"As if someone was groaning?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep, that was it."
</p>

<p>
"Now you speak of it seems as though I did.  Yes,
I remember wondering what it could be."
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear it, Lucky?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Injun too busy."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm convinced that there's someone there
and I think we ought to investigate," Bob declared.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe they've got Uncle Silas and that Long tied
up in there," Jack suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Just what I was thinking."
</p>

<p>
"Well there's a way to find out."
</p>

<p>
"I know, but I wish I was sure that Lucky got all
their guns."
</p>

<p>
"You can't be, so what's the use of wishing?  Let's
go out back and see if there's a rear door."
</p>

<p>
"You didn't get hold of a flashlight did you,
Lucky?" Bob asked as they started around back.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, I geet one," and the Indian pulled it from
his pocket and handed it to Bob.
</p>

<p>
"Good."
</p>

<p>
They found a door at the rear as they had expected
and, as they reached it, Bob said:
</p>

<p>
"No need of more than one going in.  You two
stay here and I'll see what there is there."
</p>

<p>
"You leave door open," Lucky declared.
</p>

<p>
The door was not locked and yielded readily to his
touch and he quickly stepped inside leaving it wide
open as the Indian had ordered.  It was pitch dark
inside and, for an instant, he listened.  Soon he was
conscious of heavy breathing and, pressing the
spring of the flashlight, he threw its beams about the
room.  As he had expected it was the kitchen and
in one corner, near the stove, lay the body of a man.
As Bob bent over the form he perceived that it was
a man slightly past middle age.  He bent over and
touched the man lightly on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"S-s-s-s-h," he whispered as he moved.  "Don't
make a noise."
</p>

<p>
"Who&mdash;who are you?" the man whispered.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a friend.  Are you tied?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
Bob knelt on the floor and in a moment had untied
the piece of rope with which the man's hands were
tied behind his back.  Then he released his feet which
were also tightly bound together.
</p>

<p>
"Can you get up?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I guess so."
</p>

<p>
"Just a minute and I'll help you."
</p>

<p>
He turned off the light and thrust it into his
pocket and then, putting his hands beneath the man's
shoulders he helped him to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"You are pretty weak," he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"I'm starved.  Had nothing to eat for five days."
</p>

<p>
"The brutes."
</p>

<p>
By this time they had reached the door and in
another minute were outside.
</p>

<p>
"You found him," Jack whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and they've nearly starved him."
</p>

<p>
"Who&mdash;who are you?" the man again asked
weakly.
</p>

<p>
"My name is Bob Lakewood and this is my
brother, Jack and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Lakewood, did you say?" the man interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and unless I'm mistaken you are Silas Lakewood."
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;and you&mdash;you are my nephews."
</p>

<p>
"Right, but we must not stand here talking now."
</p>

<p>
"They'll kill you if&mdash;if&mdash;" the man faltered.
</p>

<p>
"Not that bad," Bob assured him.  "You see
we've got all their guns, that is, we think we have
and&mdash;"  Then he stopped short.  "Well of all the
dumb&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter now?" Jack interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"The rifles.  We forgot them."
</p>

<p>
"What do you know about that?"
</p>

<p>
"Injun no forgeet heem."
</p>

<p>
"You mean you got them, Lucky?" Bob asked
quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Oui.  Them rifle all out whar dog be."
</p>

<p>
"But when did you do it?"
</p>

<p>
"After put leetle guns in your pocket.  Then geet
rifles."
</p>

<p>
"And I thought you had gone back for the rest of
the revolvers," Bob told him.
</p>

<p>
While talking they had been walking toward the
shed which stood about forty feet to one side of the
cabin, Bob and Jack supporting their uncle one on
each side.
</p>

<p>
"We'd better start now as soon as we can, eh
Lucky?" Bob asked as they stopped in front of the
shed.
</p>

<p>
The Indian had gone ahead to make sure that
the dogs made no noise and assured them that he
would have the team hitched in "a leetle minute."
</p>

<p>
Among their stores were several bottles of malted
milk and Bob quickly rummaged in the pack and
found one which he emptied into a dipper and
brought to his uncle.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon this is the best we can do just now," he
told him, "and I'm not sure, but that it's about the
best thing you could have if you haven't eaten for
five days."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lakewood drank the milk eagerly and declared
that nothing could have been better suited to
his needs.  He had hardly finished when Lucky
announced that the team was ready to start.  Their
snow-shoes were quickly secured, having been stuck
in the snow by the door of the cabin and, as soon
as they had arranged a place on the sled for their
uncle and had wrapped him in heavy blankets, they
were ready for the start.
</p>

<p>
"Where did you put their rifles?" Bob asked the
Indian as the latter picked up his long whip.
</p>

<p>
"Put 'em een binder pack on sled."
</p>

<p>
"Then I reckon we're all ready to start, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui, we go queek."
</p>

<p>
But at that instant, just as Lucky was about to
give the word to the dogs, Jack grabbed Bob by the
arm and whispered:
</p>

<p>
"Look."
</p>

<p>
At the same time he pointed toward the cabin and
Bob's heart skipped a beat as he saw that there was
a light in the big room.
</p>

<p>
"Now the fat's in the fire," he gasped.
</p>

<p>
"But it isn't burnt, not yet," Jack told him.  "If
Lucky got all their guns they can't do much."
</p>

<p>
"If he only did," Bob repeated.
</p>

<p>
"What'll we do?" Jack asked turning to the Indian
who stood staring at the cabin, his hands on
the handles of the sled.
</p>

<p>
"We go," he said stoically.  "Mush," he gave the
order in a voice little above a whisper, but the dogs
heard it and bounded forward in the traces.
</p>

<p>
"Have gun all ready," Lucky ordered.
</p>

<p>
In order to keep in the trail they were obliged to
pass within a few feet of the front door of the cabin
and, as the two boys, who were walking ahead of
the sled, came opposite it, it flew open and the big
leader of the gang rushed out.  But he was not off
the step before both Bob and Jack had him covered.
</p>

<p>
"Hands up."
</p>

<p>
The order evidently was no new one to the man
for he obeyed without an instant's hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you&mdash;" he started, then stopped as though
at a loss for words as he caught sight of the sled and
the man seated on it as it passed them.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what about us?" Bob demanded.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you geet away?"
</p>

<p>
"Looks like it."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but me&mdash;me tie you ver' hard," the man
stammered.
</p>

<p>
"You sure did but not hard enough."
</p>

<p>
"How you geet untie?"
</p>

<p>
"That's telling.  Hands up there," he ordered
sharply as another of the breeds appeared in the
doorway.
</p>

<p>
Instead of obeying the man dodged back into the
room and Bob's heart almost stopped.  What if the
fellow had a gun?  He could easily shoot them both
from a window.
</p>

<p>
"You geet all our gun."
</p>

<p>
Bob was not sure whether the sentence was a
question or a statement of fact.
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," he said.
</p>

<p>
He was beginning to take courage again for no
shot had come from the room and he now was almost
convinced that Lucky had indeed secured them
all.  Already the sled was some distance down the
trail, and, turning to Jack, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Let's go."  Then, turning back to the man who
still stood "reaching for the stars," he remarked:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we've got your guns and I'd advise you not
to follow us for, believe me, we shall be on the watch
and, after seeing how you have treated that man you
had in the back room, we'll not have the slightest
scruples against protecting ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"But you go leave us wid no gun we starve."
</p>

<p>
"That's your lookout, but I reckon it won't be as
bad as that."
</p>

<p>
"You geeve me only one gun?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I'm a fool?"
</p>

<p>
"Me promise me no shoot."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing doing."
</p>

<p>
Seeing that his appeal was having no effect the
man changed his attitude and became threatening.
</p>

<p>
"You no geeve us guns we keel you," he stormed.
</p>

<p>
"I have no doubt but that you will if you can,
but let me tell you once for all that if you follow us
we'll shoot the first man we see and don't you forget
it.  Come on, Jack."
</p>

<p>
Jack started off down the trail and Bob followed,
keeping his head turned and his gun trained on the
man until they were some hundred feet away.  Then
he quickened his pace and quickly caught up with
Jack who was some distance ahead.
</p>

<p>
"Talk about your minutes of suspense," he said.
"When that guy dodged back I expected to feel that
sting of a bullet any second."
</p>

<p>
"So did I, but I reckon Lucky must have made a
clean sweep of them," Jack declared.
</p>

<p>
"Well it sure saved our lives."
</p>

<p>
"You said it.  But do you think they'll follow us?"
</p>

<p>
"There's no telling.  I reckon they're a bit of a
coward when the cards are stacked against them."
</p>

<p>
"And Lucky sure stacked 'em that time," Jack
chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"Unless they find a gun which he overlooked I
don't see, but we're safe enough.  All we've got to do
is to be on our guard every minute of the time."
</p>

<p>
"You bet."
</p>

<p>
While talking they had been hurrying along as
rapidly as possible and in a few minutes they had
caught up with Lucky.
</p>

<p>
"They no follow?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I hardly think so," Bob told him.  "I tried to
make in plain to him that it would be dangerous to
do so."
</p>

<p>
"Injun mebby ought not come on leave white boy
thar but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You did exactly the right thing," Bob assured
him.
</p>

<p>
"Injun ver' sure he geet all um gun."
</p>

<p>
"And I reckon you did."
</p>

<p>
"Oui."
</p>

<p>
"Do you reckon they'll follow us?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"No can tell."
</p>

<p>
"They'll follow us."  Mr. Lakewood made the last
statement in a tone that left no doubt as to his
feelings in the matter.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you think so?" Bob asked
</p>

<p>
"Because they're scared to death of that man,
Long."
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?" Bob asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"He left two days ago for town with a load of
furs."
</p>

<p>
"On a dog sled?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"It's rather strange that we didn't meet him."
</p>

<p>
"But you came up by the river didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then that's why you didn't meet him.  You see
there's another trail back from the river and, as it's
a bit shorter, he probably took it."
</p>

<p>
"Then he can't get back for at least three days
more can he?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"It'll probably be four at the least, as he'll stay in
town for a day to rest the dogs and to fill up on
booze."
</p>

<p>
"Then I reckon we don't need fear anything from
him."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't think so."
</p>

<p>
They had not stopped while talking, but had kept
on at a slow pace but now Lucky snapped his long
lash and the dogs sprang forward at a smart trot.
</p>

<p>
"We geet on ver' queek now," he said.
</p>

<p>
While there was no moon the sky was studded
thickly with stars and, in the north great streamers
of light flashed from horizon to zenith giving them
plenty of light to travel by.  Hour followed hour and
the boys were beginning to wonder if Lucky was
never going to stop for a rest and for breakfast when
he finally ordered the dogs to halt in the middle of a
large open space the first they had encountered for
some time.
</p>

<p>
"We eat," he announced.
</p>

<p>
"You bet we'll eat," Jack assured him.
</p>

<p>
"Have go some ways geet wood but no dare stop
whar woods thick.  Bad mans may be follow."
</p>

<p>
"We'll get the wood all right," Bob said as he and
Jack started for the edge of the clearing after Lucky
had pulled an axe from the pack and handed it to
them.
</p>

<p>
They were fortunate in finding a dead tree almost
at once and inside of half an hour from the
time they had reached the place a fire was sending
its dancing flames into the darkness.  They still had
left three of the fish Jack had caught and soon they
were sizzling in the frying pan while beside it a pot
of potatoes was boiling.
</p>

<p>
"Reckon we'll have to omit the dessert," Jack
chuckled as he turned the fish.
</p>

<p>
"Who wants dessert for breakfast?" Bob laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Is this breakfast?  It's dark so much of the time
up here that it's hard to tell which is which."
</p>

<p>
Lucky, as soon as he had fed the dogs, had found
another bottle of malted milk and their uncle sat by
the fire, slowly sipping the beverage.
</p>

<p>
"Best thing I ever tasted," he told them.
</p>

<p>
"If that's good just wait till you get some of this
fish," Jack laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you are wondering how I came to be
in that fix," Mr. Lakewood said as, a little later, they
started to eat.
</p>

<p>
"We sure are," Bob assured him.  "But you'd
better wait till you get a bit of your strength back
before you tell us about it."
</p>

<p>
"This food is putting strength into me at the rate
of a mile a minute," he laughed, "and I'm plenty
strong enough to talk.  Besides I'll cut it short."
</p>

<p>
"And we'll be glad to hear about it," Bob assured
him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you probably know all about why I started
up this way so I won't go into that.  Oh yes, I was
warned as to what kind of a man Long is, but
somehow I was drawn to him and didn't believe half
that was said against him.  But now I know it was
all true and more.  He's a rascal if ever there was
one.  Everything went all right for several weeks
except that we didn't find any gold.  That didn't
worry me particularly as I came up here more from
a love of adventure than for the sake of the gold.
You see, I've got more money now than I know how
to spend, not that I mean to brag about it, you
understand, but I've always loved to hunt for gold and
other things.  But our failure to find any gold seemed
to be gradually changing Long's nature.  He became
morose and actually abusive at times.
</p>

<p>
"I stood it for some time and then one day told
him what I thought of his actions and that, unless
he cut it out, we'd part company.  Well, he seemed
to go almost crazy and, to make a long story short,
he finally blamed me for bringing him up here and
swore that I must sign over to him my interest in a
very valuable gold mine in Colorado.  Of course I
refused and he knocked me down with his fist when
my back was turned.  I struck my back somehow in
falling and have been nearly helpless ever since
although it's been getting better all the time and is
nearly well now."
</p>

<p>
"But what's his connection with those breeds?"
Bob asked as he paused.  "I suppose they're trappers."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, they're trappers and mighty good ones,
judging from the stack of pelts they've taken so far
this year.  But, as to Long's connection with them,
I only know that he has some sort of hold on them
and that, strange as it may seem, they're scared to
death of him.  We stayed in that cabin you probably
saw about half way between here and Arctic City for
several weeks and then he brought me up here.  I
don't know why.  We had been there about two
weeks and the breeds were kind enough to me when
he wasn't around, but he tried in every way he could
to force me to sign that paper.  Why he even beat
me with a whip.  Finally he declared that I'd not
get another mouthful of food till I signed it.  That
was five days ago."
</p>

<p>
"And you've been tied up since then?"
</p>

<p>
"Every minute."
</p>

<p>
"The brutes."
</p>

<p>
"You mean brute.  The breeds are really not so
bad.  Two or three of them are what you'd call good
fellows and I know they wanted to help me but they
didn't dare."
</p>

<p>
"Not even after he'd gone?"
</p>

<p>
"Not even after he'd gone.  I suspect that they
thought he might cut short his trip or get back
sooner than they expected and catch them if they did
for me what he'd ordered them not to do.  Oh, he
owns them body and soul all right but, as I said
before, I don't know how or why."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon it's lucky we got there about the time
we did," Jack grinned.
</p>

<p>
"It saved my life for I'd have died before I'd have
given in to him.  Oh, I know that sounds foolish
and I reckon it is, but I'm made that way and can't
help it."
</p>

<p>
By this time they had finished eating and Lucky
declared that they had better be on their way.  The
Indian had not said a word while Mr. Lakewood had
been telling his story, but the boys knew that he had
not missed a sentence and that he was deeply
impressed.  Mr. Lakewood asked if they had an extra
pair of snow-shoes, declaring that he was strong
enough to walk, but neither the boys nor Lucky
would listen to it and he finally consented to ride a
little longer.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
HOMEWARD BOUND.
</h3>

<p>
It was about an hour later when, as they were
passing through a particularly thick bit of woods,
Lucky spoke softly to Bob, who was striding close
by his side.
</p>

<p>
"You drive heem leetle while?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure."
</p>

<p>
"Injun go back leetle piece.  Want see any them
breed follow."
</p>

<p>
"All right, but you be careful now."
</p>

<p>
"Oui.  Injun be ver' careful."
</p>

<p>
Jack was walking some distance ahead of the team
and it was a half hour later when he glanced back
and missed the Indian.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Lucky?" he asked after waiting for the
team to catch up with him.
</p>

<p>
Bob told him where the Indian had gone and for
what purpose and Jack agreed that it was a wise
move but added:
</p>

<p>
"He ought to be catching up with us pretty soon
don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm giving him an hour and he's only been gone
about half that time."
</p>

<p>
"I imagine he can take care of himself," Mr. Lakewood
added.
</p>

<p>
"He can if anyone can," Jack agreed.  "But you've
got to remember that, if they're all following us it's
six to one."
</p>

<p>
"But the one is armed," Bob reminded him.
</p>

<p>
"I know but how do you know that they might not
have found a gun or two?"
</p>

<p>
"Who's hanging crepe now?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not, only we don't want to take too much for
granted, not this trip we don't."
</p>

<p>
Since the Indian had turned back Bob had permitted
the dogs to gradually lessen their pace as he
did not wish to get too far ahead and, for the past
few minutes they had been moving at a slow walk.
</p>

<p>
"Think we'd better wait here?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I would," Jack replied.  "You see, if he doesn't
show up soon we'll have to go back and see what's
happened to him and the farther we go on the farther
we'll have to go back," he explained.
</p>

<p>
Bob at once ordered the dogs to halt and the
willingness with which they obeyed the word showed
that they were far from rested.  There was probably
no stronger team in the state, but they had a heavy
load and for several hours Lucky had urged them on
at a rapid pace so it was not surprising that they
were tired.
</p>

<p>
Another half hour passed and they were on the
point of turning back when, without warning, the
Indian stood before them.
</p>

<p>
"Gee, but I'm glad you're back," Jack declared.
</p>

<p>
"We were beginning to think you had been
captured," Bob added.
</p>

<p>
"Injun no geet caught."
</p>

<p>
"But did you see any of the breeds?" Bob asked.
</p>

<p>
"Non, no see um."
</p>

<p>
"Then I guess they decided to take my advice."
</p>

<p>
"Oui, I t'ink so.  Injun go back three, four mile,
no see um."
</p>

<p>
"Then you think we're safe as far as they are
concerned?" Mr. Lakewood asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, I t'ink so."
</p>

<p>
They traveled at a slow pace until noon when they
stopped to cook dinner and to give the dogs a couple
of hours rest, and at four o'clock Lucky announced
that they would make camp for the night.
</p>

<p>
"We come seexty mile an' dog heem heap tired,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"And they've got nothing on me at that," Jack told
him.
</p>

<p>
"Same here," Bob added.
</p>

<p>
"And I haven't walked a foot of the way," their
uncle complained.
</p>

<p>
"No mind that," Lucky told him.  "You geet
walk 'nough time we heet Nome."
</p>

<p>
Seven o'clock found them ready to turn in with the
exception of Bob who was to stand the first watch.
They had decided to divide the night into three
watches of four hours each and Bob was to take the
first.  Mr. Lakewood had insisted on taking his turn
but the others had ruled him down, declaring that
he needed the sleep and rest and finally he had
reluctantly given in.
</p>

<p>
"But beginning tomorrow I want it distinctly
understood that I'm going to do my share of the work,"
he told them.
</p>

<p>
At eleven o'clock Bob called the Indian, who was
to take the second watch and reported that nothing
had happened.  His watch also passed without
incident as did Jack's and seven o'clock found them
once more on the trail all, including the dogs, well
rested and in high spirits.
</p>

<p>
If was about two o'clock when Jack, who was
some distance ahead and out of sight of the others
because of a clump of bushes, suddenly appeared
running back.
</p>

<p>
"What's up?" Bob asked aware that something
had happened.
</p>

<p>
"There's a dog team coming this way," he told them.
</p>

<p>
"How far away?"
</p>

<p>
"Must be nearly a mile.  There's a big open space
just ahead and he's about half way cross it."
</p>

<p>
"How many men did you see?"
</p>

<p>
"Only one."
</p>

<p>
"Then it must be Long."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I think."
</p>

<p>
"What'll we do?" Bob asked turning to Lucky.
</p>

<p>
"We go 'long, meet heem in open."
</p>

<p>
"But I'd better keep out of sight," Mr. Lakewood
proposed.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, that bon plan.  You geet on sled an' cover
all up an' heem no see you till we geet ready," Lucky
agreed.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lakewood had refused to ride except at short
intervals where the going had been exceptionally
good, but now he quickly took off the extra pair of
snow-shoes and got on the sled, and the Indian
covered him up with a blanket so that one would
never have suspected that the sled bore human
freight.
</p>

<p>
"You breathe all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure."
</p>

<p>
"Then we go.  Mush."
</p>

<p>
As they swept out into the open space they saw
the other team coming at a rapid pace and not more
than a quarter of a mile away.
</p>

<p>
"That Long," Lucky assured them.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Lucky, what you doing up here?" Long
sang out as soon as he was in easy speaking
distance.
</p>

<p>
"We on trip," the Indian told him.
</p>

<p>
"Where you been?" was the next question, and it
was plain that he was much disturbed in his mind at
meeting them.
</p>

<p>
"Up nor'."
</p>

<p>
"How far?"
</p>

<p>
"Some way."
</p>

<p>
"Did you see my gang of breeds?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui."
</p>

<p>
"Hope they treated you all right."
</p>

<p>
"Oui."
</p>

<p>
"That's good.  But, tell me, what are you up here
for?"
</p>

<p>
"We come hunt for man."
</p>

<p>
"Whatman?"
</p>

<p>
"Heem name Lakewood.  Deese boy heem nephew."
</p>

<p>
"You mean Silas Lakewood?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui."
</p>

<p>
"But he started back for Nome more'n six weeks
ago.  You knew he came with me, didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui."
</p>

<p>
"We came on a prospecting trip, but we didn't find
a thing and he got cold feet.  I wanted him to keep
on with me up to my trapping camp, but he wouldn't
do it and so I had to let him go.  He ought to have
got back to Nome long before you left."
</p>

<p>
The man was trying his best to put a lot of concern
into his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Heem no geet thar."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm sorry to hear it but, after all, it's none
of my business."
</p>

<p>
"I think it is."
</p>

<p>
The words came in a loud tone from the sled as
Mr. Lakewood threw the blanket off and got to his
feet.
</p>

<p>
"You!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is I."
</p>

<p>
"But how&mdash;how&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind how," Mr. Lakewood interrupted.
"I'm here and do you know what I'm going to do to
you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, but seeing it's four to one, I suppose you'll
take me back and file a complaint against me."
</p>

<p>
"And that's where you're wrong.  Bob," he said
turning to the boy, "cover him with your gun.  Now,
Jack, you frisk him," he ordered as soon as Bob
had obeyed.  "Now you can put up your gun," he
added after Jack had taken two revolvers from the
man's belt.  "Long, you struck me once when I wasn't
looking and in falling I hurt my back, a fact which
put me in your power for a long time.  But the
back's well now and I'm going to give you the sweetest
licking you ever had in your life.  Then you can
go your way and I'll go mine and the score will be
settled."
</p>

<p>
The boys started to remonstrate, but their uncle
stopped them.
</p>

<p>
"No, it's no use.  I never had much use for the
law when it came to a thing of this sort and this is
a pleasure I've been promising myself for a long
time."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he had removed his heavy coat and
now he ordered Long to do the same.
</p>

<p>
"I give you my word of honor," he told him, "that
this fight will be between you and me alone and if
you get the best of me you can go on your way and
I'll never take any action against you for what you've
done to me."  Then, turning to Lucky and the boys,
he ordered: "Don't one of you interfere whatever
happens."
</p>

<p>
"Heem one&mdash;what you call&mdash;game sport," Lucky
whispered.
</p>

<p>
"I'll say he is," Bob and Jack both agreed.
</p>

<p>
Long was several inches taller than his opponent
and the boys knew that his height would give him a
big advantage especially in the deep snow.  But they
were soon to learn that their fears were entirely
without foundation.  The lanky trapper undoubtedly
would have been able to give a good account of
himself pitted against almost any one, but he was no
match for Silas Lakewood.  Although nearing his
fiftieth year he had always kept himself in the prime
of condition and, as Jack after told Bob, what he
did not know about boxing simply did not exist
Three minutes after the contest started Long knew
he was licked, but he had grit enough not to beg for
mercy and he got none.
</p>

<p>
As Mr. Lakewood had promised the licking was
thorough and most beautifully administered, as Jack
put it, and when it was over one of Long's eyes was
closed completely and his face was battered almost
to a pulp, but he was not seriously injured.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't want to hurt him so that he couldn't
travel," Mr. Lakewood explained as he drew on his
coat.
</p>

<p>
"You sure do&mdash;what you call heem&mdash;one bon
job," Lucky declared.
</p>

<p>
As for Long, he stood by his sled slowly wiping
the blood from his face.  "I hope you're satisfied,"
he grunted.
</p>

<p>
"I am, perfectly and, so far as I am concerned, the
incident is closed."
</p>

<p>
"And you'll not take action against me?"
</p>

<p>
"I reckon I've taken action enough," he smiled.
"No, I'll never bother you if you keep away from
me."
</p>

<p>
"Can I have my guns back?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  And we're going to see if you have a rifle
and if you have we're going to take that too."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No buts about it.  I don't trust you not for a
minute and we're not going to take any chances.  You
may as well know that we have all the guns of your
friends which probably explains why they are not
following us.  And for that matter they may be and
we figure that should you meet up with them and had
a gun you'd be too dangerous.  No, we'll leave the
guns at Pete's store when we get back and you can
get them any time."
</p>

<p>
Long made no further remonstrance and they
searched his sled finding a rifle which they added to
the others beneath their pack.
</p>

<p>
"So long," Mr. Lakewood cried as Lucky started
his team.
</p>

<p>
But Long, who had already started made no reply.
</p>

<p>
"I guess he's sore," he chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"His face must be anyhow," Bob laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Gee, but you did it easy," Jack declared as he
looked at his uncle with admiration in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"And I'll bet my old hat you both thought I'd get
licked," he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, he's so much taller than you," Bob
said apologetically.
</p>

<p>
"But size doesn't always count, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Don't we?" Jack laughed
</p>

<p>
"When we get back you'll have to teach me some
of those blows," Bob said.  "I thought I knew something
about boxing, but after seeing you the conceit
is all knocked out of me."
</p>

<p>
"I'll teach you all I know gladly," his uncle
promised and added: "and when I get time I'll tell
you how I just missed being a prize fighter."
</p>

<p>
It was shortly after dark one afternoon about ten
days later that Lucky halted his team in front of
Pete Slinger's store in Nome.  They had made the
return trip without noteworthy event.  Long's gang
of breeds as well as the man himself, evidently
having decided to let well enough alone.
</p>

<p>
As they entered the store, Pete came from the
office to meet them but, as he was at the same time,
reading a book he did not see who it was until he
was close to them.
</p>

<p>
"Well, begorra, an' it's yerselves, so it is an' ut
sure is a sight fer sore eyes ter see yer.  An' yer found
yer uncle, eh?" he added as he caught sight of Mr.
Lakewood who entered the store last.
</p>

<p>
"We sure did," Bob laughed as he grasped the
man's hand.  "You know him don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure.  It's meself as knows him.  An' now tell us
all about ut."
</p>

<p>
"But where can I leave these things?" Mr. Lakewood
asked as he dumped an armful of rifles and
revolvers on the counter.
</p>

<p>
"Fer the luv of Mike, whar did yer pick up the
arsenal?" Pete gasped as he shook hands with
Mr. Lakewood.
</p>

<p>
"That's a part uv the story," Mr. Lakewood
smiled.  "When you get time we'll be glad to tell
you all about it."
</p>

<p>
"Whin I git time, eh.  Sure an' it's meself as
would like ter ask why I haven't got time right now,"
and, striding to the door, he turned the key in the
lock and led the way back to the office saying: "This
store is closed fer business till I get that story."
</p>

<p>
The story was soon told and when Bob, who, at
Mr. Lakewood's request, had acted as story teller for
the party, had finished, Pete burst but with:
</p>

<p>
"Sure an' it's meself as knew thot man Long was
a bad one but I niver thot as how he was thot bad.
I told yer not ter go up thar wid him yer remember."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know you did," Mr. Lakewood assured him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but it's meself as would have liked ter have
seen thot fight."
</p>

<p>
"You missed a good one let me tell you," Jack told
him.
</p>

<p>
"And how soon can we get a boat for Seattle?"
Bob asked a few minutes later.
</p>

<p>
"Cap'n Dick got in two days ago an' I reckon he'll
be goin' out aboot day after ter-morrow an' it's
barely possible he'll let yer go along," Pete grinned.
</p>

<p>
They found Captain Blake on board his ship an
hour later and the reunion between the friends was
warm indeed.  The captain confirmed Pete's statement
that he would sail the next day but one and
assured them that he would be most happy to have
them as passengers.
</p>

<p>
"We ought to get to the ranch in time for Christmas,"
Jack declared.
</p>

<p>
"Sure you will if we have a fair trip down the
coast," the captain assured them.  "But have you
wired your father?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you know about that?" Bob asked.
"Never thought of it, but I'll go right up town and
attend to it."
</p>

<p>
Two days later, after an affectionate parting with
Lucky, who, in spite of his protests was obliged to
accept a handsome present in addition to his wages,
from Mr. Lakewood and the boys, they sailed out of
the harbor just as the sun was peeping over the edge
of the ocean.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to come up here again sometime,"
Jack declared as he stood leaning on the rail for a
last hand wave to Pete Slinger who was waving
them good bye from the wharf.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe we will sometime," Bob said as he too
waved good bye.
